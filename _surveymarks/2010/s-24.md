    During our ten days on the island we probably passed this marker half a
    dozen times. Today, on our way back to Bar Harbor from our second lobster
    feast in Southwest Harbor, I asked Rich to stop so we could recover the
    mark. John probably thought I was nuts as I squished through the moss in the
    ditch, soggy from water pooled around the culvert, to take photos of a
    little disk in a stone post. To top it off, a cop car was parked about fifty
    feet away. Fortunately the cop left us alone as I photographed the disk and
    recorded the coordinates. This is one of the standard NPS boundary marker
    disks, in good condition. Unlike many of the others, this one is stamped. It
    is also set strangely off center in the post. It's very easy to spot in a
    relatively open location with the bright orange witness post nearby; it's
    just north of DeMuro's Top of the Hill Restaurant on Route 102 in Southwest
    Harbor.
