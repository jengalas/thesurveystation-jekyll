    After hiking and squirrel hunting in the Bull Hill section of Lackawanna
    State Park on a lovely, warm Monday, Rich and I noticed the letters BM SQ
    CUT painted on the road as we returned to the parking area.  The
    white-painted chiseled square on a small rock outcrop was easy to spot. 
    Unfortunately I have not yet been able to locate any data for this mark.
