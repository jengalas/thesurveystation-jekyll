    After our morning full of riding on the “quiet side” of the island, Rich and
    I decided to investigate a witness sign we'd noticed on a tree when passing
    by earlier in the day. It was a standard USGS witness sign, so I was pretty
    sure a benchmark was hiding nearby. Our datasheets indicated that it was
    most likely K 17, which for some reason we had never searched for in the
    past. At first I was fooled by the heavy blanket of moss covering everything
    in the general area; nothing appeared to be a rock outcrop and I wondered if
    I had the wrong spot. But I persevered and moved a little farther back into
    the dark woods from the road, and there was the blue disk, poking out from
    among the moss on the highest point of a mound. It is is excellent
    condition. I recommend a tripod (which, of course, I didn't have at the
    moment) for taking photos of this mark.
