    PTS 1 Y is situated as described (the steel bridge has been replaced, but
    the old abutments remain), so it made for an easy find. It's on the
    southeast corner of the east abutment of the Church Street bridge over the
    Lackawaxen River. Rich and I located it after finding Cat-in-the-hat's <a

    in Hawley - 1.1 cache</a> in the park across the street. The disk has been
    painted over at least twice but the stamping is still legible and the disk
    is in good condition. The mark is just a few yards west of a USGS gaging
    station.
