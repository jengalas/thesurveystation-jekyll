    Today one unexpected find ([15 C](/surveymarks/15-c/)) in Clifton
    was followed by another at Bradys Lake. Still determined to find an easy way
    to access the old railbed, we followed Route 2013 all the way to Route 215
    and eventually to Route 940, and then followed Bradys Lake Road straight
    north toward the dam. Roundabout, but it's really the only way to approach
    the lake. When we arrived in the parking lot, Rich indicated that there was
    another benchmark very close by - within forty feet, according to the
    coordinates he had pulled from the map. Those coordinates were quite good
    and after a few moments of searching I spotted the disk on the corner of a
    culvert passing beneath the road over the dam. A thick layer of asphalt has
    been cut back to reveal the mark. Nearby we noticed the baseline markers and
    pink-flagged stakes from recent survey work. I suspect that this mark may
    have been involved in the survey, although there was no solid evidence of
    this. The Bradys Lake sign is now missing, though its frame remains in
    place.
