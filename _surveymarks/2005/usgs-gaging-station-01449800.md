    After spending a very pleasant morning hunting fossils nearby along the
    shore of Beltzville Lake, I decided to check out this stream gaging station
    (which I had seen before), curious if a benchmark might be set nearby. I've
    seen them a few times before at gaging stations. To my delight, one was set
    here, too.
