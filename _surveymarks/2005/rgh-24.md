    RGH 24 was so close to [RGH 18](/surveymarks/rgh-18/) I couldn't resist going for it even though we didn't have much time left this morning to explore.  In addition, it allowed us to make a nice loop on our way back to the car, and—bonus!—there are some stone ruins near the mark that I hadn't yet seen.  Stone relics from the old gravity railroad can still be found along the trails on this mountain.  
    
    
    We were tricked a bit by the datasheet diagram and the vegetation growing over the boulder, but after a few minutes of searching we found the right boulder and the chiseled square on its highest point.  After documenting it and examining the stone ruins further down the trail, it was time to leave.  I was glad Rich had a chance to take this trail also, as he mentioned it's been years since he hiked here.  A little bit of unexpected woodchuck hunting  on the way back to the car made the day complete.  The blueberries are almost ready!
