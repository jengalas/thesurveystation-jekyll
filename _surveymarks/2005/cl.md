    Because of the current reconstruction and restoration of this downtown area,
    it seems nearly every corner holds some sort of survey markâ€”either a cross
    chiseled in the sidewalk, or a survey disk. This PATH disk, CL, is a disk
    set in the sidewalk near the corner of Church Street and Liberty Street
    (hence the designation CL). It is in good condition.
