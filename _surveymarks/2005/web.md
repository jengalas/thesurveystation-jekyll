    Because of the current reconstruction and restoration of this downtown area,
    it seems nearly every corner holds some sort of survey markâ€”either a cross
    chiseled in the sidewalk, or a survey disk. WEB is a disk set in the
    sidewalk at the corner of the West Side Highway and Barclay Street (hence
    the designation WEB). It is in good condition.
