    We found this mark as described, set in the south face of a gray-painted,
    curved concrete wall partially surrounding the southeast corner (Hudson &
    Clarkson Streets) of the James J. Walker ballfield. The benchmark was hard
    to spot beneath the thick layer of gray paint. The paint also makes the
    stamping difficult to distinguish, but with some effort it can still be
    read.
