    This mark appears to be lost. It is evident from the descriptions of this
    mark and [KV0598](/surveymarks/kv0598/) that both
    were set in similar concrete walls at opposite sides of the James J. Walker
    ballfield along Hudson Street. But the wall surrounding the field on its
    northwest corner has been replaced with a lower concrete wall which no
    longer matches the high, curving wall on the ballfield's southwest corner.
    We searched all along the wall, walking Leroy Street from Hudson to 7th
    Avenue South, just to be sure. We found no sign of the mark.
