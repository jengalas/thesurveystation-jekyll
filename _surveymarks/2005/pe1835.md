    This was my second benchmark find on a day that went very quickly from 90°
    and sunny (while we were hiking on Bar Island) to about 45°, dark and misty
    (while we were eating our lobster lunch at Beal's). At the lighthouse, the
    conditions were cold and foggy, but we still took some time for photos and
    exploration. The lighthouse is beautiful and I hope we were able to do it
    some justice with our photographs, even though we could only capture it from
    the usual viewpoint this time. Had we known about the nearby BASS HARBOR
    RESET mark, we may have searched for it as well (or simply saved it for a
    warmer day!).
