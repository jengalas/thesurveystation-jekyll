    The municipal building is beautiful, and the recently refurbished statue
    added a touch of uplifting gold to the gray sky on the day of our visit. The
    statue is entitled “Civic Fame” and it is 20 feet tall—quite impressive,
    though it certainly looks much smaller from the ground. We first spotted the
    building from Broadway, near the Woolworth Building, but then moved to City
    Hall Park for a different perspective.
