    To reach bench mark RGH 22 from the intersection of Rt. 348 and Rt. 247 in Mt. Cobb, follow Rt. 247 north for 2.7 km (1.71 mi) to a power line crossing. Turn left onto the power line and go approximately 100 m to a dirt trail on the right.

    Continuing our search for the marks in PennDOT's RGH line, this morning Rich
    and I hiked up to the dams and then continued on to the trail intersection
    where we hoped to find RGH 22. We had searched in March with only the
    coordinates to go on, and had no luck finding the chiseled square (though we
    did find an impressive boulder that we were surprised they hadn't used).
    This time, we found the mark immediately. It was closer to the intersection
    than the spot we had originally searched; in fact we found the coordinates
    on the datasheet to differ by about 140 ft. from the coordinates we recorded
    at the mark. Our attempts to find RGH 23, which should be located about 0.3
    mi. along the trail and a cut line to the southeast, were unsuccessful.
