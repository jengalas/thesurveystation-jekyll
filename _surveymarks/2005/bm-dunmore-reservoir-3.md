    On a sloppy but warm Friday Rich and I took a short hike to the reservoirs.
    Just a few weeks ago I found a website listing some PennDOT survey marks,
    and we noticed a line that begins at the reservoir and follows the trails
    and gravity railroad bed down to ROAR 2 in Dunmore. I was anxious to see
    what we could find. Rich was familiar with the area but didn't remember
    seeing a concrete spillway near the coordinates. We spent some time
    searching the woods near the coordinates just in case, but there was no
    spillway or other concrete structures to be found. The coordinates listed on
    PennDOT's datasheet are at the west end of the north wall of Reservoir #3,
    while the mark is actually located on the spillway at the west edge of the
    reservoir. We walked further and eventually found the mark, recorded
    coordinates and documented it with photos. The chiseled mark may be much
    older than PennDOT's established date of 1999. The square has been painted
    over quite some time ago.
