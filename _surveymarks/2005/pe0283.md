    After breakfast on our last day in Bar Harbor, Aaron, Rich and I took a
    long, slow (wet) walk around town and decided to document three marks near
    the waterfront that have gone missing. The bench this mark was set into has
    been removed from the site, as part of the current reconstruction project at
    the park.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. This one, like many of the others I had hunted, was found during a very pleasant after-breakfast walk around town. The mark was relatively easy to find using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 273 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is quite visible and is in excellent condition. I must've walked by this mark at least a hundred times in the 30 years I've been coming here! ~Rich in NEPA~
