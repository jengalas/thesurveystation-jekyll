    The station mark and reference marks 1 and 2 were recovered in good
    condition.  This mountain is now known as Eliot Mountain.

    This was my first benchmark find on a day that went very quickly from 90°
    and sunny (while we were hiking on Bar Island) to about 45°, dark and misty
    (while we were eating our lobster lunch at Beal's). Fortunately for us, the
    weather was still sunny and hot when we reached Eliot Mountain. After
    exploring Thuya Garden and finding the Eliot Mountain geocache, Rich and I
    took a moment to search for and recover this set of marks (Aaron poked
    around elsewhere, or maybe he took a nap?!). This 135-year-old bolt was easy
    to find, and appears to be in good condition. There is some possible damage
    to one edge, but the bolt seems very solid in the bedrock. Both reference
    marks were found easily and in good condition as well.
