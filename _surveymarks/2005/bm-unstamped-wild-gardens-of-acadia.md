    This chilly, drizzly Tuesday was just perfect for knocking some “rainy-day” activities off our list. Of course, we all hoped we wouldn't have to resort to that list at all, but it's been a strange weather year up in Acadia. After spending the morning eating a leisurely breakfast at—where else?!—Cafe This Way, we strolled through the Abbe Indian Museum (where I somehow picked up the nickname Molly Molasses) and then hiked the Jessup Trail, with a short detour along the Hemlock Trail, to Sieur de Monts Spring, the original Abbe Museum, the wildlife center and the Wild Gardens of Acadia.
    
    
    While not much was in bloom in the gardens, we did enjoy wandering the paths and identifying some of the herbs and berries (wild strawberries!) that we saw. An extra treat for me was spotting this shiny gold benchmark on a little bridge near the entrance to the gardens. It is entirely unstamped except for the typical “BM”, so I have no idea of the date, elevation, or agency responsible for this mark.
