    Rich, Aaron and I first spotted this mark while on our unintentional Fourth
    of July death walk around Cortez. Much too hot, sweaty and exhausted to
    consider examining it in any detail that day, we gave it little more than a
    glance. Rich and I returned a few weeks later (just after giving up on the
    [Country Birds Sing](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCP69E_country-birds-sing) geocache due to poison ivy) to document the mark. It's one of
    the most recently set marks I've found, and it's in excellent condition. The
    mark is set into the east headwall of a new concrete bridge over
    Wallenpaupack Creek (West Branch) along Cortez Rd.
