    Our first day in Acadia was lovely, sunny and hot. Immediately after arriving and getting settled, Rich took us on an afternoon hike to Great Head, a most scenic spot to begin our vacation. All three marks in this set are in good condition and are easy to find as described.


    No report was submitted to NGS at this time; the most recent report was less than a year ago, and the condition of the mark has not changed in the meantime.
    
    
    _**UPDATE:**_ Photographs of GREAT HEAD by Rich and me are featured in the book [Lasting Impressions: A Glimpse into the Legacy of Surveying](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0976504383), Rhonda Rushing, Berntsen International, Inc., 2006.


    _**UPDATE:**_ Rich and I were married at this survey station on September 13, 2011!
