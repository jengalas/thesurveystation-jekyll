    While in Portland for a morning of shopping and exploring, I couldn't help searching for a few local benchmarks. This one is well marked with a painted triangle and the designation “J 11”, is situated according to the description, and was easy to find. The disk itself appears to be in good condition, though a small amount of the concrete under the disk has come loose. While I was photographing the mark, I heard a train approaching and for a moment considered that I might be in its path. But I soon spotted it moving along another set of tracks across the street. The train added a neat touch to this railroad benchmark recovery.
    
    
    _No report was submitted to NGS at this time. This station was recovered two months ago by PennDOT and its condition has not changed._
