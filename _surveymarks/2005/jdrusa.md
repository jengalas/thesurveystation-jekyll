    What an adventure! After a long, hot, wonderful morning of sunrise-viewing,
    seal-watching, benchmark hunting and hiking, Rich and I decided we'd enjoy
    an afternoon hike up on Champlain Mountain. As the Precipice Trail was
    closed this early in the season (to my great disappointment), we decided to
    hike the Bear Brook Trail instead. The hike began in the same kinds of
    conditions we'd experienced all morning—sunny and humid—but halfway up, we
    heard something, turned, and saw a thunderstorm coming at us straight across
    the bay. Yikes! We had little time to do anything but cover ourselves,
    crouch down, and wait. It was frightening, exhilarating, and hilarious all
    at once. The storm passed directly over and the thunder was amazing, but we
    didn't experience any nearby lightning strikes. The rain was pounding us
    like handfuls of stones; I could hardly believe it was simply rain and not
    hail. After the storm passed (and after Rich took a few wacky photos of me
    wrapped up in my emergency poncho), we set out again for the top of the
    mountain. And of course, it showered once or twice more. This time we got
    soaked, but didn't mind as the air was still warm. Our main goal for this
    hike was to search for the NEWPORT tri-station (which Rich had already found
    a few years ago, but was new to me), but along the way back down we also
    spotted this mark, JDR/USA. This weathered boundary marker is found along
    the Bear Brook Trail on the north ridge of Champlain Mountain.
