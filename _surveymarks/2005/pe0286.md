    After breakfast on our last day in Bar Harbor, Aaron, Rich and I took a long, slow (wet) walk around town and decided to document three marks near the waterfront that have gone missing. The seawall into which the mark was set has been taken down and a new one has been built in its place.


    _Photos of the mark in place in 2002 and of the current situation were submitted to NGS, which has marked this station officially Destroyed in the database._

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. This one, like many of the others I had hunted, was found during a very pleasant after-breakfast walk around town. The mark was relatively easy to find using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 237 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is quite visible and is in excellent condition. I must've walked right by this mark dozens of times in the 30 years I've been visiting here! ~Rich in NEPA~
