    Because of the current reconstruction and restoration of this downtown area,
    it seems nearly every corner holds some sort of survey markâ€”either a cross
    chiseled in the sidewalk, or a survey disk. BP is a disk set in the sidewalk
    at the corner of West Broadway and Park Place (hence the designation BP). It
    is in good condition.
