    The station mark was recovered in good condition. Both reference mark 1 and
    reference mark 4 are in poor condition with only their shanks remaining. The
    marks are located in an empty lot just northwest of Topp Business Solutions,
    and the former to reach is adequate. The powerline poles were found as
    described. The witness post no longer exists.

    I initially thought that recovering this set of marks was going to require parking at ToppCopy and climbing over a wire fence, but I got a lucky break this time. I hadn't noticed it when scouting out the mark, but there is a convenient opening cut in the fence directly behind one of the powerline poles (number 56922 N44837) referenced in the station description. I was able to walk right through; I wonder if the fence was cut to allow easier access to the marks.
    
    
    My new GPSr took me to within 2 feet of the station mark, and it was easy to spot because the rock outcropping was clear of snow and debris. The outcropping into which RM 1 was set was similarly simple to find, but I was disappointed to see that the disk was vandalized and only the shank remains. (I did not realize until later in the evening that RM 1 has its own [datasheet](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=LY1379), which does note the destruction.) Locating RM 4 proved to be a challenge. I took measurements from the end of the east-west paved road and from powerline pole 56906 N44818 in order to pinpoint the spot. The measurements brought me directly to the mark, which was found after removing some litter and mud packed around the mark. This mark too has been vandalized, with only the shank remaining; this is noted on its [datasheet](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=ly2281). There was no sign of a witness post as mentioned in the 1976 description.
