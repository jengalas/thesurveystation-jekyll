    We found this mark on our way home from a messy encounter with Skipsp's
    geocache [A
    View of the Park](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCNA6K_a-view-of-the-park) at nearby McDade Park. The lot of the Open Door Baptist
    Church on Keyser Avenue was a convenient spot to park as it's just south of
    the bridge. We could see the mark from across the street. The mark is in
    good condition and seems solid in its setting, though the concrete layer
    atop the masonry headwall is deteriorating. The stamping is clear and the
    disk appears almost untouched—unusual for a mark in such an exposed, public
    location.
