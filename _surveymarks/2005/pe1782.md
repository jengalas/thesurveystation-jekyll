    Our first day in Acadia was lovely, sunny and hot. Immediately after arriving and getting settled, Rich took us on an afternoon hike to Great Head, a most scenic spot to begin our vacation. This tower is quite obviously destroyed, but the ruins are still in place and I had fun climbing around and exploring them, and playing on the beach down below afterward.
