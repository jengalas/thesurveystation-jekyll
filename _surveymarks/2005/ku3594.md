    The Consolidated Gas & Electric Company (now Consolidated Edison) clocktower
    was our first stop on our day-long visit to the city. We viewed the
    clocktower from several angles, and then wandered inside and found some
    historical information on a plaque posted in the lobby. The clocktower was
    not part of the original building but was added during the 1920s, with
    construction ending in 1928. The building is located as described, on the
    corner of 14th and Irving Place.
