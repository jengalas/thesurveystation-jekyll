    Walking north along Hudson Street from James J. Walker Park, where I
    searched for KV0598 and KV0599, I soon came to P. S. #3 on the corner of
    Hudson and Grove. I was encouraged to see that the building is still being
    used as a school, but as my luck would have it the maintenance men were
    washing the front steps today and the entire area was barricaded off. Based
    on previous recovery notes I have very little hope that the mark still
    exists, but would've liked the chance to investigate for myself anyway.
    Perhaps on our next visit!
