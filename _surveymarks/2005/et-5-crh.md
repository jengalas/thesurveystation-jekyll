    This horizontal control station is conveniently located along the trail to
    [On
    the Roost](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMV3W_on-the-roost), so even though Aaron was with us, there was simply no way Rich and I could resist recovering this mark. Fortunately, it didn't take
    long! The mark is in excellent condition and right out in the open along a
    field road as described, the only difference being that the fence just north
    of the mark has been removed. This mark is located just outside the boundary
    of SGL #119.
