    This was my fourth benchmark find on a day that went very quickly from 90°
    and sunny (while we were hiking on Bar Island) to about 45°, dark and misty
    (while we were eating our lobster lunch at Beal's). Still beneath a heavy
    fog, we drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain intending to log a few
    benchmarks and a virtual cache. MOUNT DESERT RESET was easy to find, as were
    both of its reference marks and the USGS station [K 24](/surveymarks/k-24/). All marks appear to be in fair to good
    condition.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along the Park Loop Road from Bar Harbor up to the summit of Cadillac Mountain and easily found all FOUR marks in this set using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 7.5 feet from the posted coordinates for the station. These four discs were all quite visible and are in excellent condition. I've hiked this trail many times. ~Rich in NEPA~
