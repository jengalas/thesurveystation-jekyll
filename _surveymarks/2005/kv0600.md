    This huge red brick building is hard to miss! Previously the Federal
    Archives building, it was converted in the late 1980s to commercial and
    residential space (Monica Lewinsky reportedly resides here). The mark is set
    as described in the east face of the red brick building at the southwest
    corner of the intersection of Christopher and Greenwich Streets. The mark is
    in good condition.
