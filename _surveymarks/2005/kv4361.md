    The Woolworth Building is a stunning example of ornate neo-Gothic
    architecture in a modern “cathedral of commerce.” It's almost 800 feet tall
    with only three minor setbacks, so it seems to soar vertically to the sky
    from any angle. I had trouble finding a good spot on a nearby street to take
    a photo!
