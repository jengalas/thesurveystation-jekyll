    Recovered in good condition. Door sill and mark have been covered with
    yellow paint. The doorway is no longer covered and the mark can be accessed
    easily from the sidewalk.

    This was our final NGS mark for the day. As the previous finder mentioned, the entire door sill has been painted over with a thick layer of yellow paint, and as a result the mark was difficult to spot even though the directions were explicit. I walked past it twice before noticing the vague “lump” on the Parcel Post door sill. Currently the mark is easily accessible from the sidewalk; though there is still construction in the area, the doorway is no longer covered by plywood as is mentioned in the January 2004 NGS recovery note. I was unable to get a GPS reading of any kind in this area.


    Like “Trippers,” we then explored the area a bit and found many more marks nearby. Because of the current reconstruction and restoration of this downtown area, it seems nearly every corner holds some sort of survey mark—either a cross chiseled in the sidewalk, or a survey disk.


    We found and documented the following disks: [WEB](/surveymarks/web/), [WEM](/surveymarks/wem/), [BP](/surveymarks/bp/), [CD](/surveymarks/cd/), [CL](/surveymarks/cl/), [BRD](/surveymarks/brd/)


    We also found BB, but we couldn't photograph it because at the moment it was located directly beneath the feet of a woman working at a souvenir stand.
