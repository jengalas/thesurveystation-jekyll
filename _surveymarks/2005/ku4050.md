    The Glenwood Power Station stacks can still be viewed from this station.

    Rich and I had a few tri-stations in mind as possible diversions on our
    day-trip to the Palisades, but the main goal of the day was just hiking and
    exploring. We followed the “low road” south and eventually circled back
    using the trails on top of the cliffs, finding several caches along the way.
    On our leisurely hike back to the car we made our way out each and every
    little trail we encountered, to every overlook we could find. Eventually we
    found ourselves very close to the coordinates for BURNETT. Despite some
    slight trepidation, we climbed through the fence and out onto the cliff. We
    found the drill hole and chiseled cross immediately. The mark itself appears
    to be in fine condition, though we were unable to locate any of the
    reference landmarks other than the power station. This is one of our most
    scenic benchmark finds to date.
