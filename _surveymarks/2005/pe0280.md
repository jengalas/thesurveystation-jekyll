    After watching a less-than-spectacular but still awesome sunrise from
    Cadillac Mountain, for which we got up at 3:15am, Rich decided we could stop
    for a few benchmarks on the way back to Bar Harbor. [K 23](/surveymarks/pe0279/) (PE0279)
    was first, followed shortly thereafter by this mark. It was very easy to
    find, set prominently in an outcropping rock just off the road. We noted
    that the fence mentioned in the datasheet description was removed at some
    point between Rich's initial log in 2002 and our 2005 visit.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along Route 233 from Bar Harbor and easily found the mark using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 90 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is quite visible and is in excellent condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
