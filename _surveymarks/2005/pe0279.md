    This benchmark has the distinction of being my “earliest ever” find—at just
    before 5:35am. After watching a less-than-spectacular but still awesome
    sunrise from Cadillac Mountain, for which we got up at 3:15am, Rich decided
    we could stop for a few benchmarks on the way back to Bar Harbor. Having no
    datasheet or coordinates with us wasn't a problem this time. Rich wasn't
    positive he had exactly the right location for this one as it's been almost
    three years since he first found it, but I ran up the little hill he
    indicated and checked the most obvious outcropping, and there was the mark!
    It's in fine condition, was well-exposed and easy to see from a distance,
    and the historic description is accurate.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along the Park Loop Road from Bar Harbor and easily found the mark using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 64 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc was partially covered by dried pine litter and it is in very good condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
