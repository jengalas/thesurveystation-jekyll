    For a change of pace, I decided to seek out some Scranton benchmarks this
    morning. After finding [MINOOKA RESET](/surveymarks/aj2429/) in
    Scranton's south side, I drove to Green Ridge, turned down Race Street into
    the Plot section, and then spotted the 1904 truss bridge from a block away.
    The station has been in recent use; it is circled in fluorescent orange
    paint and orange markings have been made on the bridge as well. The disk is
    in good condition with all stamping clearly legible. The description is
    accurate, though it might be better to reference the nearby intersection of
    Race Street and Amelia Avenue than the intersection of Depot Street and
    Amelia Avenue, which is 500 feet from the mark.
