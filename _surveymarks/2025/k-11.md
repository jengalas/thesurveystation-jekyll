  K 11 is quite an intriguing mark. Both the topo map coordinates and the MaineDOT coordinates are off significantly. We actually spotted a likely ledge on Street View last winter when we were researching marks to target during this year's trip to Maine, but we almost wrote it off because usually the topo map coordinates are much more accurate. In this case, if the ledge were the correct location, the topo map coordinates would have been off by 125 feet or so. 
  
  
  When we arrived at the site, though, I could tell that there was no large ledge anywhere the topo coordinates, so Rich parked and I checked the large ledge we'd spotted on Street View anyway. I immediately spotted the marker on top! So cool. I'm still trying to figure out which building was the parsonage, if it still exists, and what the discrepancy is with the topo map coordinates. But it was an exciting find, and it's always fun when there is more research to do. 


  The disk is in very good condition, and the ledge is solid and doesn't appear in any danger of being damaged or compromised. The ledge is located between #137 and #144 Old Bar Harbor Road, just west of the Edgewater Motel, Cottages, and Suites.
