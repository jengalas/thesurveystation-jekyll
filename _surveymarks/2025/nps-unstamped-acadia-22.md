  Rich and I took a quick walk down to Otter Creek Landing this morning, just because we've never checked it out before. The simple boat ramp may not appear very exciting, but we spotted not only a garter snake here, but also three NPS boundary markers in close proximity! This was the second one we spotted, on a granite post west of the boat ramp, near the edge of the woods. The granite post is hidden deep in the grass, but the post seems solid, and the unstamped disk is in good condition.
