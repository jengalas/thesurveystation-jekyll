  Rich and I took a quick walk down to Otter Creek Landing this morning, just because we've never checked it out before. The simple boat ramp may not appear very exciting, but we spotted not only a garter snake here, but also three NPS boundary markers in close proximity! I spotted this one first, when I happened to turn my head at just the right angle while I was standing on the dock. The granite post is leaning quite sharply but it seems solid otherwise. The disk is unstamped, and is in good condition.
