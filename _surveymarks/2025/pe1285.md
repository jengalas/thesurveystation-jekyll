  As you may have expected, as we walked around Wiscasset this morning, I took a quick look at my application that allows me to plat nearby NGS benchmarks on a map. There was one that interested me just two blocks down Water Street from a small public lot where we had parked. The benchmark in question was supposed to be at the intersection of Water and Fore Streets, set vertically in the wall of the former post office. 


  When we reached the building (which had once housed a post office as mentioned in the benchmark description, but was more commonly known as the [Customs House](https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/2ce36399-554f-499d-8d48-d8f34581e3f6)), we spotted the benchmark immediately from the opposite side of Water Street. But my heart sank when I saw the sign indicating it was a private residence, and we noticed that the two entrances from the sidewalk level were roped off.


  Four people were sitting at a picnic table in front of the building, working on something. We debated whether to approach them and Rich decided just to go underneath the "barrier," such as it was, and ask the people if we could recover the mark. Not only did they not even flinch when we came onto the property, but the man we spoke with was very interested in the mark, how benchmarks are used, and what we mean by "recovering" it. He was so interested that we even heard him telling the other people at the table about it, excitedly, when he returned to them. He provided contact information that I can use for the official recovery, and we were surprised to learn that the man moved here from Lackawaxen (although he was originally from New York). 


  Property records show that the building is owned by Customs House LLC with a contact address in Lackawaxen, so I can only assume that maybe they are planning to renovate the building, and maybe eventually open it to the public or use it for some commercial purpose? It would be interesting to find out.

  The disk is in very good condition. We also discovered later that it is part of the series of nearby National Ocean Service tidal marks, [station 841 6921](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/benchmarks.html?id=8416921).
