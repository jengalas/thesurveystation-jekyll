  This church is now St. Philip’s Episcopal Church. As described in the 2001 recovery note, the spire is now painted white with a golden cross atop the spire. The address is 12 Hodge Street.

  This was the second of two church spire landmark stations we found this morning. The first was a white spire on the nearby Congregational Church. This one, the second, was once a brown spire but is now also painted white. There is no reason to think that the spire or the church have been otherwise modified, though, since the station was first observed in 1857 and 1934. The church is St. Philip's Episcopal Church.
