    After a failed attempt to investigate the rim of Meteor Crater to search for
    the station there, we stopped at Walnut Canyon to see what it had to offer.
    It was a real treat! We were glad to find our “consolation prize” of this
    survey disk at an overlook. Neither of us had ever heard of an
    “archaeological datum,” but we assumed it had to do with a survey of the
    cliff dwellings or other archaeological ruins in the area.
