    It seems likely that this mark and its associated reference marks are still
    in place. Although there is now a house nearby, the area around the marks
    appears wooded and untouched. We have not yet asked for permission to search
    the area, however. We did search for, and recover, the azimuth mark because
    it is easily accessible alongside a road.
