    This “easy roadside bench mark” was more of a challenge than we'd expected. 
    It was in an awkward place to reach and to photograph, and we had plenty of
    thorny branches to clear before we could even get a good look at the mark. 
    The mark is in good condition; however, a new bridge has been built and this
    old bridge deprecated.  I wonder whether its days are numbered.
