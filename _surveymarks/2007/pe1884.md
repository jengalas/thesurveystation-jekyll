    After our very exciting find of a station that had been considered lost for 73 years (nearby [RICHARDS 1865](/surveymarks/pe1885/)) we just had to stop for one more before heading home. HADLEYS POINT was a great choice because it's so close to RICHARDS, and was another very old station that we had been interested in for some time. This station was last recovered in 1979, so it's been a while since this station was visited, and we hoped to be able to provide an update.


    While this station is very close to the campgrounds at Hadley's Point, it's technically on private property. At no time did we feel like anyone would give us any trouble for poking around there, though. The station mark was an easy find, set in a rock outcrop at the base of a tree. It is a standard disk rather than a bolt, as noted in the 1979 description. From the stamping on the disk (HADLEYS POINT 1865 1934), it appears that the bolt was replaced by the disk in 1934, but curiously the 1934 description mentions the bolt and does not say anything about replacing it with a disk.


    Both reference marks are set on large boulders in a wooded area near the station. They were easy to find and are also in good condition. 


    There is an old foundation near the station and for a few minutes, I wondered if it might have marked the site of Abraham Richardson's house mentioned in the 1865 description. It's in the wrong direction from the mark, so I assume it was not the same building, but it nevertheless lent an interesting historical aspect to this hunt! If only we could find out what it was.

      alt: Originally I wondered whether this might be part of the foundation from the house mentioned in the 1865 description. It seems it cannot be, since it’s in the wrong direction, but it’s still picturesque and neat!
