    What could be better than hunting a benchmark after indulging in lobster?! We enjoyed both activities today while spending time in Southwest Harbor.
    
    
    This was just a landmark station, but it turned out to be more interesting than I'd expected.  We arrived at the church (now called the Manset Union Church) to discover that the entire structure had been moved from its foundation! Construction work is underway. We suspect that the building will be returned to its original location (approximately) once the new foundation is complete, but the mark will still probably be considered Destroyed due to the movement.
