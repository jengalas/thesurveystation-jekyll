    This was a fun mark to find, and it's in such a beautiful location! Like a
    few others in this area, HULL is a topographic disk, something a little
    different from the majority of marks we find. This one also had us wandering
    around on private property belonging to the Bar Harbor Yacht
    Clubâ€”fortunately we didn't need to go anywhere near their facilities and
    were able to walk out to Canoe Point through the woods without any problems.
    The disk is in very good condition and is set into a nice smooth rocky ledge
    that would be perfect for a picnic overlooking the bay.
