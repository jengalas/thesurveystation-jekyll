    This morning was our last at the Canyon, and we soon headed along the East
    Rim drive and away from Grand Canyon Village.  Our first stop wasn't even
    going to be a stop.  Many times benchmarks that look interesting at home are
    less than thrilling once we arrive at the spot; oftentimes they may well be
    interesting, but the other activities of the day may overshadow the desire
    for a benchmark hunt, or simply push it away.  In this case, I was fully
    prepared to drive on by T 482, but Rich drove tantalizingly slow past the
    coordinates anyway, and I couldn't resist a peek into the woods.  Well, what
    do you know, there's the witness sign!  I hopped out and found the mark
    easily, along with a bonus mark (PP38) belonging to a local surveyor just a
    few yards away.  Just a few yards from the road and an old service station,
    these marks are located in a pretty wood filled with pinyon pines, red rocky
    soil and with a small woods road running by the sandstone outcrop that holds
    the NGS disk.  The disk is in excellent condition and is easily accessible.
