    After our touristy-but-fun sailing on the Margaret Todd, Rich and I wandered
    around the pier; I had a sneaking suspicion that some of the other new NOS
    marks would be nearby, perhaps on the other side of the main building at the
    municipal pier (the one that houses the Fish House Grill), which is an area
    we had never checked before.  This was the first of the two marks that we
    spotted. It is set into the middle of the concrete berm a hundred feet or so
    to the southwest of the second mark (TIDAL F), on a promenade area between
    Stewman's and the Fish House Grill. This new disk is in very good condition.
