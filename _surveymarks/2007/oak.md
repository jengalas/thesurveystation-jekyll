    As we drove along Route 89A, Rich suggested that we stop at Oak Creek Vista,
    an overlook point offering a view over Oak Creek Canyon. It featured,
    according to the sign at the pull-off, a Native American arts and crafts
    fair. That was interesting enough, but to top it off we soon spotted two
    unexpected but very familiar items at the overlookâ€”two survey mark disks
    just a few feet apart!  OAK is a Forest Service disk set on top of the rock
    wall surrounding the overlook. It is in good condition.
