    We were on our way from Ajo to Organ Pipe National Monument (and ultimately
    into Mexico) this morning when we happened to spot what looked like a round
    concrete monument alongside the highway. We stopped at a convenient pulloff
    to check it out, and we were in luckâ€”there was indeed a benchmark disk set
    in the top of the monument! It is part of the 333 line that follows this
    highway. The disk and monument are in good condition.
