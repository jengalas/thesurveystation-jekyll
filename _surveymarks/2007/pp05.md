    This afternoon we took a quick drive to see the Chapel of the Holy Cross, a
    fifty year old, 200 foot tall structure set right in between two massive red
    rock formations.  It gives the impression of having grown right out of the
    rocks.  Designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, I'm sure the interior
    is unique and interesting as well.  The place looked like an anthill
    crawling with visitors when we arrived, though, so we only viewed the church
    from the outside.  How fortunate, also, that I spotted a survey disk in a
    small clearing below the chapel!  Rich pulled onto the shoulder and waited
    in the car while I examined the mark and took some photos.  This lowly
    survey disk surely has some of the best imaginable surroundings! It's a
    local surveyor's disk and is in good condition.
