    Rich and I happened to spot this new (set just last year) tidal station
    while wandering around the area waiting to join our sailing of the Margaret
    Todd. It's set into the seawall, on the ocean side of the fence, so taking
    photos was a bit tricky. It's near an angle in the seawall about 100 feet
    west of the Shore Path entrance to the Bar Harbor Inn. This new mark is in
    very good condition.

      alt: Precariously balanced atop the seawall, I was very happy that I got the famous gazebo into this shot!

      alt: The mark can be seen through the fence. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the water was calm.
