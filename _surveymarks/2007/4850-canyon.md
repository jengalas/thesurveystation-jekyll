    While on our descent into the canyon along the Bright Angel Trail, I
    suggested a detour to search for two USGS benchmark disks I had seen on the
    topo map. They were just a short distance off the trail, but what incredible
    views these sites offered—probably views seen by very few people, since most
    people (probably wisely) stick to the trail. We had no problem reaching
    either of the locations, and never felt in any danger. This was the second
    of two disks that we found off the trail. This disk is undated (but based on
    the style was likely established between 1900 and 1910) and is in good
    condition.
