    As we drove along Route 89A, Rich suggested that we stop at  Oak Creek
    Vista, an overlook point offering a view over Oak Creek Canyon.  It
    featured, according to the sign at the pull-off, a Native American arts and
    crafts fair.  That was interesting enough, but to top it off we soon spotted
    two unexpected but very familiar items at the overlookâ€”two survey mark disks
    just a few feet apart! 3002-10 is not in such a glamorous location; it's set
    in the concrete pad for a garbage can. The disk is in fair condition but has
    suffered some damage and the bottom right edge is broken off.
