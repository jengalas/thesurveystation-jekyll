    After our descent of he South Rim and return to the top, we had time for
    another little adventure. I was desperate to find at least one of the Boston
    Museum survey marks to add the color of personal experience to my “Resurvey
    of the Heart of the Grand Canyon” report.  So far, our casual searches had
    been busts.  We decided to give HOPI a try, and took the shuttle bus to Hopi
    Point to have a look around.  The mark was right at our feet, on a prominent
    outcrop, near a monument to Colonel Claude Birdseye.  It was also surrounded
    by sightseers.  The disk is in excellent condition and very easy to find. It
    was so exciting to see one of the Boston Museum marks in person!
