    The station mark was found in good condition. The private road is a woods
    road, blocked by a cable, leading south toward the river (near Wallpack
    Bend). The white board fence no longer exists. The original reference post
    is no longer at the site, but an orange stake marked “FHWA” now marks the
    spot. White plastic sheeting in the form of an X over the mark marks its
    location for photogrammetric purposes.
