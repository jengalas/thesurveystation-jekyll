    Hungry after a day's worth of breathtaking hiking in Chiricahua National
    Monument, we returned to the visitors center to ask if the rangers or
    volunteers had any dinner recommendations. While talking with one of the
    volunteers we happened to mention that we like to search for benchmarks, and
    she mentioned that there was one at Faraway Ranch. We just had to go there
    to check it out! What a treat. Not only is the ranch beautiful but the
    benchmark was set right into the corner of the walkway surrounding the
    house, easy to spot, in excellent condition, and in a very picturesque
    location!
