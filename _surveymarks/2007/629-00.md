    After visiting Kitt Peak (and making an exciting tri-station recovery
    there!) we had two more marks in store for us on the way back down the road.
    We just happened to spot this one on a culvert just off the side of the
    road. It's a Bureau of Public Roads mark, which is a new one for us! The
    disk is in good to fair condition with legible stamping.
