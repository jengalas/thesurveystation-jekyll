    On a morning filled with benchmark explorations, we stopped at the Hull's
    Cove beach across Route 3 from the Colony Motel to search for K 10. It's a
    USGS benchmark that we've known about for a while (since we received the
    USGS datasheets) but today was our first good opportunity to search for it.
    We found it in excellent condition, just as described, on the high rock
    ledge. We did not see the "P.B.M. 17.1" on the ledge (if it was painted, the
    paint is probably long gone). We also did not find the chiseled square that
    served as the RM, but we would like to come back to search for it again.
