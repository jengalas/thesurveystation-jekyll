    After our touristy-but-fun sailing on the Margaret Todd, Rich and I wandered
    around the pier; I had a sneaking suspicion that some of the other new NOS
    marks would be nearby, perhaps on the other side of the which is an area we
    had never checked before.  We were able to find two. This mark was the
    second one, set into the corner of the seawall along West Street right at
    the intersection of the pier that is used for whale watch launches and
    cruise ship passenger arrivals. The disk is directly behind a structure
    resembling wooden benches (although there is no way to sit on it) and is
    easy to spot, if not so easy to photograph. Being so new, the disk is in
    excellent condition.
