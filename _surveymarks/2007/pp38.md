    Just a few yards away from NGS vertical control mark T 482, I spotted this
    disk, a marker set by a New Mexico surveying firm. It's set on a rod
    embedded in the ground; it wasn't clear if it was set into bedrock below the
    surface, but that's a good guess unless it was intended to be a temporary
    mark (unlikely).
