    This mark was easy to find, but unfortunately it is in very poor condition.
    It's set into a cut stone that was once part of an old masonry culvert over
    a small creek. But the stone has been moved out of place and is now leaning
    at an angle, half on the ground and partially touching the stone beneath.
    The disk itself is in fine condition, but with its setting so disturbed it
    is useless. We had to wonder how this damage occurred.
