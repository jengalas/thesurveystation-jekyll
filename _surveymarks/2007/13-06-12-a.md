    Rich and I returned today to the scene of last week's deluge.  This time,
    though, we drove to the southern terminus of the trail (at Glen Onoko, which
    is also the starting point for the annual Death Hike) and planned to ride
    north to Penn Haven Junction, where we had turned around last time, or
    perhaps even further to Rockport. We made it to Rockport, as you can tell by
    the fact that we found this survey monument at the bridge over Buck Mountain
    Creek at Rockport. It's dated 1991 and it's right in the middle of the
    trail, so I'm not sure how we didn't notice it before. It's a Carbon County
    GPS station (we've found at least one of these before) and is in good
    condition.
