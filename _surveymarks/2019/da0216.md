    This standard benchmark disk also served as a reference mark (RM 2) for the
    nearby triangulation station [COVERED](/surveymarks/da1475/), which
    is located on the opposite (north) side of Route 86. It is set in a concrete
    monument that projects about 6 inches above the ground, so it was very easy
    to spot. The disk is in excellent condition.
