    Our second tri-station for today was an easy find along a fence row on the
    south side of Route 86. It was similar to others we've found in Arizona that
    feature all three marks in a straight line, rather than the triangular
    layout we typically see for a triangulation station and its reference marks.
    These marks were close together and all were in excellent condition in round
    concrete monuments.  Bonus: they were surrounded by gorgeous brilliant
    orange wildflowers!
