    While we were enjoying a delicious dinner at nearby Primavera, I thought
    about this benchmark and the fact that in all the years we've driven by the
    old school, we never stopped to look for it. Now that the building houses
    apartments and a theater, it seemed like it would be easy enough to access.
    Rich thought it sounded like a good idea too. After dinner we parked in the
    lot along Theodore Street and I passed through an unlocked gate to the front
    lawn, making my way around to the front of the building. The mark was easy
    to find and was in excellent condition.
