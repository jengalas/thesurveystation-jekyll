    Continuing along Route 86 on our way from Tucson to Ajo, we stopped next to
    look for POZO, an AZDOT tri-station located a slight distance up a small
    knoll north of the highway. The station was an easy find set in a
    rather-obvious round concrete monument near a barbed wire fence. While we
    were exploring the area, we noticed that one reference mark, RM 2, was on
    the opposite side of the barbed wire. Fortunately it was easy enough to step
    through and recover the mark. We found RM 1 a few yards down the hill from
    the station. It was also an easy find set in a small outcropping boulder. As
    neat as the tri-station was, though, our favorite find in this area were the
    two young ferocactuses near the skeleton of a dead ferocactus ... and a tiny
    seedling that we spotted growing up within the rocks!
