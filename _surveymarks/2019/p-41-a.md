    This relatively new NPS boundary marker was found along a small stretch of
    abandoned road in the woods between Bloomfield Road and Duck Brook Road. A
    local blogger has called this an “[abandoned
    entrance](https://abandonedtrailsofacadianationalpark.blogspot.com/2020/06/abandoned-entrance-into-acadia-national.html)” into the park. Although it is clearly an abandoned stretch of
    road, that description is a bit more dramatic than I think is warranted. To
    me, it just looks like a section of what was called the "New Eagle Lake
    Road" on the 1942 topo map (now called Duck Brook Road), that has since been
    closed off and abandoned, for whatever reason. I suppose the fact that West
    Street Extension had not yet been constructed may have made this a somewhat
    more direct way into the park. This area is crisscrossed with short
    intersecting roads (Champlain Road, Bloomfield Road, Highbrook Road,
    Cleftstone, etc.) that will be familiar to MDI historians. Several of these
    roads bounded Woodbury Park, a popular destination at one point in the
    park's history, as it was a beginning point for hikes to Great Hill and
    other nearby points of interest. This boundary marker is in good condition.
