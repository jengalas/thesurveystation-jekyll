    P 112 was the third mark on today's benchmark-hunting tour of the west side
    of Saguaro National Park.  This was another easy roadside find, set in a
    square concrete monument just across Kinney Road from the entrance to the
    Ironwood Picnic Area.  We found the disk and monument in good condition
    without any difficulty. A nicely detailed recovery from 2001 on the NGS
    datasheet was also a great help in locating the mark.
