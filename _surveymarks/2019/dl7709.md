    After our find of A 471 right next to the highway, we headed toward the
    visitors center to look for the CORS station and a few other marks in that
    area. We found the CORS station easily (coordinates don't get any better
    than that, literally!) after a short but slightly scratchy walk through the
    brush. There's so much vegetation here this year! There are at least half a
    dozen other instruments near the CORS stationâ€”we assume weather stations and
    other environmental monitoring apparatus.
