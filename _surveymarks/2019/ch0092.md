    G 308 still has us stymied! It should be as simple a find as the others in
    this area: concrete monuments that project enough to be visible in this
    desert landscape for tens of meters around, often still accompanied by their
    original witness posts. But we had no luck at all with this one. We searched
    at both the NGS and USGS coordinates (less than 100 feet apart in this case)
    and wandered around the entire area, surprised that we were unable to find
    anything. Referring to the description, we noticed that (assuming it's
    correct) we should have been searching much closer to the road, but that
    area yielded nothing either. We'll have to take another look when we're back
    in this area. I can't think of a good reason why this mark would be gone, so
    it's probably still here, and either we just happened to miss it, or the
    coordinates and description are off enough that we were looking in the wrong
    spot.
