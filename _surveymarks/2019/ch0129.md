    W 109 was our final benchmark attempt on our drive west along Puerto Blanco
    Drive to Quitobaquito Spring. We didn't have USGS coordinates to work with
    because this mark doesn't appear on any of the topo maps we can find. The
    NGS coordinates are scaled, which typically means they're not very accurate,
    but they are all we had available to us today, other than the description.
    We used both the NGS coordinates and the description and searched both sides
    of the road (just in case), looking for any sign of the mark or the other
    references in the description. We found no sign of the old adobe house or
    the drainage ditch. There is no reason to think that this mark would have
    been removed; it's probably still here, and we just missed it. I want to try
    again!
