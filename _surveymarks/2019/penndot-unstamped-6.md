    We always take the fun route over the ridge when we go to Point Phillips.
    It's narrow and winds around and around up to Smith Gap and then down
    againâ€”almost like a very tiny Moki Dugway. We pass through Kunkletown before
    heading up the mountain, and this time when we turned onto Chestnut Ridge
    Road Rich happened to notice a survey mark on one of the corners of the
    bridge. It's a PDT mark (older than the new PennDOT disks but newer than the
    PDH disks). Unfortunately it has no stamping, so we don't know its
    designation or date. The mark is in good condition.
