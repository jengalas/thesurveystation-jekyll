    A 308 was our final find as we made our way along Puerto Blanco Drive toward
    Quitobaquito Spring. Like the others we found in the series, the mark was in
    good condition and was easy to find because it's close to the road and the
    monument projects several inches above the desert floor. (Having decent USGS
    coordinates pulled from the topo map also helps!) The witness post was
    nowhere to be found, but the concrete base in which it had been set is still
    very easy to spot just a few feet away from the mark.
