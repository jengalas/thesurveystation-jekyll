    This was a very easy mark to findâ€”we could see the witness sign from the highway! After finding the CORS station and poking around at the visitors center in search of another benchmark (that we were unable to find), we took a quick ride just a quarter mile down the highway. I spotted the mark as we went by, and Rich pulled over so I could hike in and photograph it.
    
    
    I suspect this mark is or was used frequently because the disk was circled with spray paint and the old wooden witness post (still at the site) was at some point replaced with a metal one. The disk and monument are in good condition.
