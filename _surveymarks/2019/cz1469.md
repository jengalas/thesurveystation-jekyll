    Tonight's adventure, following a delicious pizza supper at Reilly, was an
    attempt to find two downtown Tucson benchmarks we had never looked for in
    the past. It was a short walk from the restaurant through the nearly
    deserted downtown toward the courthouse/city hall buildings. The first mark,
    U 19 RESET, was an easy find, set into the concrete base of a former light
    pole. The disk is in good condition with legible stamping.
