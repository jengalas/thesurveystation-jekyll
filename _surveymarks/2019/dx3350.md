    Recovered in good condition. The stub of the witness post is still evident,
    as noted in the 2004 recovery.

    At one pulloff north of Cottonwood Spring, we noticed a neat rock ledge with
    what looked like the bottom few inches of a signpost embedded in it. My
    first thought, of course, was “witness post,” although I didn't see a survey
    mark immediately nearby. But a moment later I turned around and, in a small
    depression in the rock, I spotted one! So cool! It's always exciting when we
    find a mark serendipitously. The disk is in very good condition and the
    witness post, as mentioned, has been sheared off but the remaining piece of
    the signpost is still evident and easy to spot.
