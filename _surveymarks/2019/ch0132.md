    Mark not found. There are several park signs in the immediate area, but none
    seem to match the description. Witness post not found.

    After our hike along part of the old Ajo-Sonoyta highway, we were just about
    done with benchmark hunting for the dayâ€”but we had one more on our list.  It
    was supposed to be at the intersection of Ajo Mountain Drive and Highway 85,
    but we had no luck with this one. The description notes that the mark was a
    rod without a sleeve, set flush, both of which can make a mark difficult to
    find as time passes and the landscape changes.  The description mentions a
    park sign; there are a few in the area, but none of them seemed to match the
    sign described. There was very little else to go on. We couldn't even find
    any sign of the witness post or where it might have been established. We
    think this mark may be below grade now, or possibly even gone due to
    widening of the highway.
