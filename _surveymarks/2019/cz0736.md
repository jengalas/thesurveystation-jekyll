    The first mark we found along Kinney Road was B 291, a very straightforward
    find in a round concrete monument in an open area, surrounded by a cool
    assortment of cacti (and guarded by a special little mammillaria)! We found
    the mark immediately and documented it, and then poked around for a few
    minutes enjoying all the cacti.
