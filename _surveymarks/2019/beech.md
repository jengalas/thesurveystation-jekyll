    For a few years now we've been wanting to take Dad to the fire tower at the
    summit of Beech Mountain, but so far it hadn't worked out. This year it
    figured nicely into our plans, and as a bonus, we would be able to recover
    the one remaining URI survey mark, BEECH, that we had yet to find. The hike
    to the summit is short and steep and mostly wooded, with a few short
    stretches across open ledges. We passed through beech, hemlock and laurel.
    Before long we were on the summit ledge, and before reaching the fire tower
    we stopped to look for the mark. It was set in 2011 and was in excellent
    condition if you can ignore the goofy stamping.
