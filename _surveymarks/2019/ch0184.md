    Moving on from Gachado Line Camp, the border road (Camino de Dos Republicas)
    curves south to travel right alongside the border. At this spot there is a
    high fence that unfortunately partially blocked our view, and limited our
    photo-taking, of the obelisk that serves as the border monument. The
    reference marks were supposedly set along the fenceline, but we couldn't
    find them, and due to the fence and barbed wire couldn't get close enough
    for a true search.There was a dirt berm along the road which may have been
    pushed up over the reference marks, concealing them. We also realized that
    the next mark on our list, [SHACK](/surveymarks/ch0185/), served as
    the azimuth mark for this monument.
