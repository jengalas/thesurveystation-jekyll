    We were unsure about what to do today, and we eventually decided to walk the
    length of Breakneck Road, which I've never hiked completely.  As soon as we
    began our walk near Rocky Mann's pottery studio, we came upon two NPS
    boundary monuments, both with disks, one on each side of the road. They were
    unusual disks, small and gold-brown in color. This one, B 25, is on the east
    side of the road nearer to the studio. The disk and the granite post appear
    to be in good condition.
