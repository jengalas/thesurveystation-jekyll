    Rich and I were searching for some benchmarks along crazy Route 85 this
    morning, on our way to Organ Pipe National Monument. We decided to pass on
    the first mark on our list because there was no safe place to park. But we
    found a nice pulloff near the coordinates for the second mark on our list.
    While I was walking toward the coordinates, Rich called out that he had
    found it. But he hadn'tâ€”he had actually found a different mark! This one was
    set by the Bureau of Public Roads. Unfortunately there is no date stamped on
    the mark, and I wasn't able to locate a description for it among any of my
    resources. The disk is in good condition, and the monument seems to be in
    fairly good condition as well, although somewhat eroded.
