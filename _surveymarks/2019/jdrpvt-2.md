    This boundary monument spotted on the abandoned Archbold estate is one of
    many we've found along park boundaries designated JDR/PVT. Today alone, we
    found four more very similarly stamped monuments on this property and the
    adjacent property to the north (Barberry Ledge, the old Rowell estate).
    There are also many stone markers, without disks, on the properties. The
    disk is in decent condition but the post is leaning at an angle. It appears
    to be solidly set, and so is probably good enough to indicate the correct
    historical boundary. (This area now belongs to Acadia National Park.)
