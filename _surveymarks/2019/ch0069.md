    After our fruitless benchmark search near the visitors center, we headed
    onto the Ajo Mountain Drive to look for two more benchmarks along the way to
    the southern end of the old county road. (Which was not really the southern
    end of the road, but it is the southern end of the part that's now used as a
    trail.) The first, B 312, was a very easy find on a prominent rock outcrop.
    I was hoping the white painted letters "BM" from the 1953 description would
    still be evident, but I wasn't too surprised that they weren't. The witness
    post and sign are still in place. The mark is in excellent condition.
