    H 308 was our third find on this day full of benchmark-hunting adventures!
    It was an easy find, which was a bit surprising to us because USGS was
    supposedly unable to find it in 1984. The coordinates and description were
    correct, even down to the distance from the point where the road crosses a
    wash. The disk and monument are in good condition. The witness post is no
    longer evident.
