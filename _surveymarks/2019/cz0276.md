    The second benchmark find on tonight's post-supper adventure was about a
    tenth of a mile west of the first mark. We were interested in that mark
    because of its designation, TUCSON, but I was already aware that it might be
    a challenging find because a geocacher had mentioned that it was hidden
    beneath some landscaping stones. It was indeed covered over when we found
    it, but there was a depression in the stones that guided me to check that
    particular spot. It was very fortunate that the depression was there,
    otherwise the mark would have been nearly impossible to find; it was buried
    about 3 inches down. The disk is in good condition overall, although the
    designation is difficult to read.
