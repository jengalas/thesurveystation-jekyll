    This was one of the two gravity disks we found very close to 106 DOR USGS.
    This one is set about 65 feet south of 106 DOR USGS. It's set on a face of
    the boulder that slopes away from the wash where we walked, so it was a
    little tricky to photograph. Rich found it by pacing off the distance from
    the USGS benchmark. His pacing is generally very accurate!
