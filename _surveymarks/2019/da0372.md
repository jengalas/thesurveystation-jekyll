    Recovered in good condition. The old Ajo-Sonoyta Road is now a hiking trail
    accessible from Alamo Canyon Road to the north and Ajo Mountain Drive to the
    south. The mark is approximately 50 feet, not 398 feet, west of the
    centerline of the old road (now hiking trail). The witness post was not
    found.

    X 110 was our last find for today along the old Ajo-Sonoyta county road. We
    had hoped to make our way to the next one (Z 309), but it was a little
    farther than we were prepared to go on such a hot and surprisingly humid—for
    Arizona—day. We found the mark easily using the USGS coordinates from the
    topo map, and it is in good condition although the witness post is gone. We
    discovered an error in the NGS description. It places the mark 398 feet west
    of the centerline of the road, which is way off. Rich measured it at 17
    paces (about 50 feet) west of the centerline of the road. After our hike, we
    drove the full Ajo Mountain Drive loop, which is always a beautiful and
    scenic adventure where you're guaranteed to see many, many organ pipe cacti!
