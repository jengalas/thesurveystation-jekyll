    This mark was an easy find, and easy to access because it's so close to a parking area. It's set into a small outcrop in a narrow area of grass northwest of a parking lot for a wharf.  The disk is in good condition. Rich and I came here after a lobster lunch in Southwest Harbor in search of this mark and another mark in this tidal series, TIDAL 4, which is just a few hundred feet north on another ledge.
