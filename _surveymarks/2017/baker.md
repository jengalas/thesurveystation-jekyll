    Although Rich and I were here in 2014, we weren't aware of this survey mark at the time. We returned this year with Dad, who had a great time on Baker Island and wasn't even too bothered by the need to transfer to the island by way of a small skiffâ€”something I had been a little concerned about due to his history of seasickness.
    
    
    After enjoying the talk by the ranger and hiking to the south beach where we had our lunch, the three of us returned a bit early to the area near the lighthouse so we could search for the mark. It was an easy find, on the ledge where we expected to find it. Nearby is a long line of rocks, possibly from an old wall or part of a foundation.  The disk is in excellent condition.
