    P 308 was our final find in the 308 series today. There are plenty more along Puerto Blanco Drive, but I didn't have a chance to find the coordinates for the others, so we stopped after finding P 308 and then headed straight toward Quitobaquito Springs. 
    
    
    Just like the others in the series, this mark was in very good condition and was easy to spot in a large round concrete monument set very close to the road. The witness post is now gone, but the concrete that once held it remains at the site. 
    
    
    Searching for this series of bench marks was a fun and relaxing diversion, perfectly suited to a 100+ day that began with a scorpion sting. The most difficult thing about recovering most of these marks was taking a closeup photo without my shadow getting in the way! And we have plenty left to search for next time.
