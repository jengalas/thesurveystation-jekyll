    This is a guest recovery from Dave, Zhanna's dad. While walking around Tampa
    before his Western Caribbean cruise, Dave found this Army Corps of Engineers
    disk set into the west end of the Cass Street drawbridge, south of the road.
    It's just a few feet from the automatic gate arm and is set flush in the
    concrete bridge pier. The disk is in very good condition.
