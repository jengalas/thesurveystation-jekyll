    K 308 was our third find along Puerto Blanco Drive, as we headed west toward
    Quitobaquito Spring.  Like J 308, the disk and monument are in excellent
    condition, and the witness post is intact.  At just a few yards from the
    road, this mark, like the others we found nearby, is perfect for a quick
    find on a hot day!
