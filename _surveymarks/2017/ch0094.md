    This was the second mark we found on our travels along Puerto Blanco Drive,
    headed west toward Quitobaquito Spring. The monument was easy to spot from
    the road, and it and the disk are in excellent condition. Part of a wooden
    post set in concrete—presumably a witness post—is just a few feet away. This
    mark is very close to the Mexican border, and the border fences and Mexican
    Highway 2 are easily visible from the site.
