    After Dad left this morning for his return trip home, Rich and I decided to
    check out a relatively “new” trail: the Kebo Brook Trail, an old trail that
    was rehabilitated and put back on the maps in 2012.  Our main goal was to
    check out the trail and take some photographs while the morning was still
    foggy (although that didn't last long). I had no idea we would spot a
    boundary marker with disk while we were walking along the trail!  It was
    several yards into the woods close to the Kebo Valley golf course, but quite
    easy to spot and to access from the trail.  The boundary disk is divided
    into three parts, two of which are stamped JDR and one which is stamped PVT.
    The disk is in good condition and is adjacent to a standard orange NPS
    boundary post.
