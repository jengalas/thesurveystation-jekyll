    We took a nice third of a mile hike along the Wonderland Trail to the disk,
    which is set into a ledge in a protected area, as described. Somehow even
    though the trail was super busy today, no one came by while I was behind the
    rope “barrier,” which is always a relief. I did my best to step only on the
    bedrock and not on the lichen or mosses growing on it. The disk is in
    excellent condition. It is not stamped.
