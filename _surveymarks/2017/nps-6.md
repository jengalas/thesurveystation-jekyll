    NPS 6 was a surprise find at Tumacacori National Monument. We were initially
    looking for [B
    432](/surveymarks/cg0875/) (CG0875) that is supposedly near the parking area. We didn't find B
    432 (we are quite sure that it's buried) but while we were looking, we
    spotted this NPS/AZ Highway Department disk set into the sidewalk along the
    eastern edge of the parking area. It is in good condition with legible
    stamping, although the year is not stamped on the disk.
