    D 291 was the first benchmark I noticed on the map when I began researching
    marks for our trip. Cool, it's at Old Tucson! We don't really have any
    interest in this old west-style theme park, but it's still neat that there's
    a benchmark on their property, right next to the parking lot. The mark was
    an easy find, and a bit harder to photograph since the monument is now
    beneath a sprawling creosote bush. It is in good condition and the 2001
    description is still accurate.
