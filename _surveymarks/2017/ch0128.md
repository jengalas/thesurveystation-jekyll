    Our last find for today was unexpected and really neat! Rich's scorpion
    sting ended my coordinate-finding activities this morning, so I hadn't
    pulled coordinates for any marks this far west along Puerto Blanco Drive.
    But we were looking at the topo map while trying to find the grave near
    Quitobaquito Spring when Rich spotted “BM 1131” indicated on the map near
    the intersection of Puerto Blanco Drive and Pozo Nuevo Road. We were very
    close by so as we passed through the intersection, we looked around for the
    mark, and Rich saw it! Like the other marks we found along this road, it is
    in excellent condition and is set in a pretty obvious round concrete
    monument. There is an impression in concrete a few feet away that once held
    the witness post, although the post is now gone.
