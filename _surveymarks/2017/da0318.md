    In our evening wander about town, after an “interesting” meal at Agave
    Grill, Rich and I recovered a few easy benchmarks. The first was at the
    Curley School and the second was this one, at the old Tucson, Cornelia, and
    Gila Bend Railroad passenger station. The station is now a visitors center
    and it forms the centerpiece of the plaza in the heart of Ajo. The center
    wasn't open on Sunday evening, so we didn't get to check out the offerings.
    But the benchmark was an easy find on the platform (northeast) side of the
    building. The disk is in good condition and is no longer covered with paint
    as mentioned in the 2006 NGS recovery note.
