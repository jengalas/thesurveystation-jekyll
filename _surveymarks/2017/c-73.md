    Rich, Dad and I were on our way to the Point Phillips Hotel after a morning
    of hiking at Hickory Run State Park and a successful benchmark recovery in
    Albrightsville. We made a quick stop at the corners in Jonas to look for
    this mark. Unfortunately, we weren't able to find it. I checked both sides
    of the “concrete platform” facing the intersection to the southwest, but the
    entire foundation is covered with a thick layer of mulch in preparation for
    new landscaping. The mark is probably still in place, but there is currently
    no good way to locate it.
