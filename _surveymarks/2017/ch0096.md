    Continuing along Puerto Blanco Drive toward Quitobaquito Spring, L 308 was
    next up on our list.  It was another easy find. Like the others in this
    series, it's set into a round concrete monument that projects a few inches,
    making it easy to spot from the road. There was once a witness post but it
    is now gone; the impression in the concrete that once held the witness post
    remains.
