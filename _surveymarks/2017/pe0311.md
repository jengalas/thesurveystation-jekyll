    This is a tidal mark like TIDAL 6 STA 13 nearby, but rather than a disk, it's a cross chiseled in an outcrop. This is quite unusual in my experience, so I was excited to look for this mark. After we found TIDAL 6, I walked across the shell- and seaweed-covered beach (which wasn't as slippery as it looked) toward the ledge. The cross is a bit difficult to spot, but it's about two feet south of a metal rod protruding from the ledge, so that should help to locate it. This mark may be difficult to reach at high tide!
