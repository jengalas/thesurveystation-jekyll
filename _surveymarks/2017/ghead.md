    Rich and I first learned about this mark almost a year ago, and we were so excited to look for it! Not only is it on Great Head, where we were married, but it was set in 2011, the year we were married. Like several other marks around the island, it's part of a series set in 2011 by the University of Rhode Island and the National Park Service, as part of a “backbone survey” of the park. 
    
    
    We arrived at Sand Beach after a morning spent on the Great Meadow and Jesup Paths, having walked all the way from town to Sieur de Monts.  It was still foggy at Sand Beach, believe it or not, although it had been clear for hours everywhere else. The beach was very busy today, as you would expect from a warm, gorgeous Saturday. We crossed the beach and headed up, up, up the bluffs toward the Great Head survey marker. 
    
    
    There were so many people climbing up that it took some time and some maneuvering to take some people-free photos. The survey mark was an easy find, in good condition, and again, a perfect symbolic mark for me and Rich!
