    Rich and I spent part of our sixth anniversary on MARS!


    Well, actually, we spent it hiking with Dad, exploring McFarland Mountain. It was perfect! Our main goal was to see how we could access the mountain (our first try this morning, via the Acadian Ridge Trail, didn't work out so well). We then hiked through the field and straight up the ski slope, as suggested by [Matt Marchon](http://matthewmarchon.weebly.com/), so we could locate the old ski tow rope equipment. (Next time, we'll try the trail to the top that meets the weather station road near its intersection with Eagle Lake Road.)


    Other than the short, steep, straight shot up the old ski slope, it was an easy hike to the summit, which is marked by a large cairn. The MARS disk is nearby and it was in excellent condition, as expected. It was so cool to show Dad part of the park, and some excellent views, that few people have ever seenâ€”and to see them for ourselves!
