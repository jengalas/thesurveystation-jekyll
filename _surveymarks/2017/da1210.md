    Benchmarks set in historic buildings such as schools and train stations always attract my attention. They usually aren't difficult to find, but they give me a chance to explore the history of a new town as I research its buildings and public spaces.
    
    
    L 469 is set into the base of the doorway at the old Curley School, an impressive and imposing buiding filling the triangle between Venanda and Esperanza Avenues. We visited around 7:00pm and the fading daylight added a somber quality to the scene. Rich and I both wondered what it would have been like to attend grade school here, years ago. The old school building has since been turned into apartments that are rented out as live-work space for artists and artisans. We didn't notice much activity when we visited, though.
