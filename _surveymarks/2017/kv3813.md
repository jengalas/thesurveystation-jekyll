    This is another guest recovery from Zhanna's dad Dave! 
    
    
    Dad was driving a sports team from a local university to Immaculata University near Exton, PA. While he was there, I asked where he was parked, and then I took a quick look at the NGS site to see if there might be any marks nearby. I saw a tri-station called IMMACULATA right on campus. Turns out the mark was right in the parking lot where he dropped off the students, and he had taken a quick photo with his phone! He didn't have a chance to look for any reference marks, but I still thought this was a neat find worthy of documenting. Dad said that the mark is in good condition, but is in a slight depression in the parking lot so it had accumulated a lot of dirt, salt and cinders from the winter.
