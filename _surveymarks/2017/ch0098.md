    Continuing on our hunt for the “308” series along Puerto Blanco Drive, we
    came to the next letter in the alphabet: N. N 308 is just north of the road
    and, like the others, set into a large round concrete monument. The disk is
    in very good condition. There was no sign of the witness post, not even a
    mound of concrete with an impression in it like we found near a few of the
    other marks along this road.
