    This is a guest recovery from Dave, Zhanna's dad. While walking around Tampa
    before his Western Caribbean cruise, Dave looked for this benchmark disk set
    into the old city hall building. He has confirmed that the disk is in place
    and in good condition, but because the building is currently undergoing
    renovations and is surrounded by scaffolding, he wasn't able to get a
    close-up photo of the disk. It is on the corner shown, just to the left of
    the inscription 1915, of which a tiny corner can be seen.
