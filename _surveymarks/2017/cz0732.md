    N 112 was an easy find close to Brown Mountain, which we hiked this morning before searching for a few benchmarks in the area. We had to laugh when we noticed on the NGS datasheet that this was yet another completely obvious mark that the US Power Squadron claimed they couldn't find. “Hey Power Squadron,” we joked, “you can't find marks in Arizona from a bar in Key West!” 


    The handheld coordinates provided to NGS by a geocacher were pretty good as was the description, and we walked right up to the monument. The witness post makes it even easier to spot from the road. The only slight challenge here was taking a few decent photos without contacting cactus spines—I failed in that regard since I sat squarely on a prickly pear while trying to get a closeup view. (Fortunately only the spines and not glochids got me!)


    The disk is in good condition and in addition to the original stamping of **N 112**, was also stamped **DOT** at a later date, as noted on the datasheet recovery from 2006.
