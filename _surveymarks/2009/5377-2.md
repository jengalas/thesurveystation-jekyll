    Today we were on a relaxed tour of some of our favorite hiking and exploring
    spots. Between watching some rock climbers at Otter Cliffs and visiting the
    Asticou Azalea Gardens, we stopped at the bridge over Little Harbor Brook to
    look for a MaineDOT mark I had recently read about on their website. We
    found the disk just as described on the northeast wingwall of the bridge. We
    also spotted a very interesting triangular monument nearby, just west of the
    bridge. I have no idea what this monument might signify—maybe a boundary? It
    does have some numbers carved or formed into it, but they don't indicate to
    me what the monument might be.
