    Today was a decent weather day (for February) and I was in the area doing some grad school research at nearby Misericordia University.  Afterwards, I thought I'd treat myself to a simple benchmark hunt.  This disk was indeed quite easy to find.  It's set into a granite stepâ€”not a window sill as described, although it may have been a window sill at one point.  The disk is in good condition, especially considering that it is probably stepped on many times each day.  The bank is now a branch of the Citizens Bank.  
    
    
    This mark is not being reported to NGS because it was recovered less than a year ago by PennDOT, which found a discrepancy and computed a new NAVD88 elevation of 1126.862 ft.
