    Our goal for today was to ride the carriage trails at Minnewaska State Park,
    and along our route to recover the CASTLE POINT triangulation station at
    (unsurprisingly) Castle Point.  The Castle Point carriageway contains a
    long, gradual climb of about three miles but with plenty of overlooks along
    the way, of which we took full advantage. Once we reached the ledges at
    Castle Point, finding the triangulation station and associated reference
    marks was simple. The Blueberry Run Path basically passes right over the
    station, and the reference marks were well exposed and exactly where the
    datasheet specified they would be. All disks are in good condition.
