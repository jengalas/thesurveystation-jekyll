    We decided to follow our GPS's directions today, and so we ended up taking a
    slightly different route than usual to New Paltz.  We turned east off Route
    209 near Cuddebackville onto Route 211, which we followed through Otisville
    and Howells before heading northeast. This mark, on Bruynswick Road, was
    along our route. It was an easy find because the post projects prominently
    above the grassy shoulder of the road. The reference objects from the
    description were not found.
