    2 HLZ, which had been located at the Methodist Church in Cortez, was our
    only bummer of the day. I wasn’t able to find anything set in the only steps
    I could see on the property, and I searched the adjoining walk for any signs
    of old benchmarks as well. Nothing seemed to match the description
    perfectly, so perhaps the building has changed. There does appear to be an
    addition to the front of the church, where perhaps grand doors once stood.

      alt: Looking S toward the church. I searched the walkway to the left of, and wrapping around, the church.
