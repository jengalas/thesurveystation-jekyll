    We took the long way around the island on our way back to Bar Harbor from
    Beal's Lobster Pound in Southwest Harbor. Along Pretty Marsh Road we
    happened to spot this boundary marker, thanks to the bright orange witness
    post next to it. Unlike other boundary markers nearby, this one is stamped
    with a designation (Q 1). It is at the edge of the woods just behind a post
    and driveway indicating the address 220 Pretty Marsh Road. The disk and post
    are in good condition.
