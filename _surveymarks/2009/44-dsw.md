    I didn't know what to expect when we did our preliminary investigation on
    this mark from home. The large rock is clearly visible on Google Street
    View, but it's so close to the road that we had every reason to suspect that
    the mark was probably long gone. It was a very pleasant surprise to find
    that it's still in place and in excellent condition! The disk is a
    cookie-style aluminum USGS disk (I call them that because they are thicker
    than the typical NGS disks and appear, well, cookie-like as a result).
