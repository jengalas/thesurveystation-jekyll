    Rich and I took full advantage of this hot April day and headed to
    Minnewaska State Park (and eventually Mohonk Preserve) for some mountain
    biking. Thai at Lemongrass in New Paltz was our choice for dinner, but on
    the way there we stopped to search for this mark on the Route 299 bridge
    over the Wallkill River. The disk is in good condition and was easy to find,
    although it will probably be obscured by vegetation in the summer.
