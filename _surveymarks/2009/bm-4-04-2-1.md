    We were on our way back home after searching for a few marks in Madison
    Township when I spotted a bright blue disk on a culvert headwall off Moosic
    Lake Road. Rich found a safe spot to pull over and I investigated the mark.
    It's an old PA Dept. of Highways disk without any stamping, but that I later
    discovered is desginated BM #4 (04-2-1). The description from the PennDOT
    datasheet is available below.
