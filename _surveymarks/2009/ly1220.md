    Mark not found. All corners of the bridge were checked. On the lower shelf
    at the southeast corner of the bridge, the stem of a disk and its impression
    in cement were found. There was no sign of the disk itself. The bridge
    crosses over Kellum Creek and is near the intersection of Aberdeen Road and
    Reservoir Road.

    For some reason we've been spending quite a bit of time in this area
    lately-maybe the proximity to cider donuts at Ritter's Cider Mill in Wimmers
    has something to do with it? Today's goal was to find M 233, an NGS mark set
    in the lower shelf of an old bridge over Kellum Creek. I climbed down to the
    base of the bridge and cleared off some accumulated debris from the
    southeast corner, but I didn't find the mark underneath. Only the stem of
    the disk and the circular impression of the disk in cement remain. Just to
    be sure, I checked the other corners of the base of the bridge, but found
    nothing.
