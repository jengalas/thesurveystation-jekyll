    Our day in Eastport culminated in a quick hike up Battery Hill to search for a special kind of landmark station—an International Boundary Commission range marker. We found both that landmark station and another, undocumented, vertical control mark on top of the bluff. We also enjoyed panoramic views of Eastport and the bay.


    We were descending the bluff on our way back to the car when Rich said “Hey, look at that” and he pointed to the next little knoll. I saw something on top but couldn't tell what in the world it was. Rich recognized it immediately, though. “I think it's a CORS station!” We took some photos as documentation even though we still weren't completely certain. A check of the NGS database later in the evening confirmed that Rich had been correct. We had found a CORS station, symbol EPRT. Data can be found here: [CORS - EPRT](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-cors/corsage.prl?site=EPRT).
