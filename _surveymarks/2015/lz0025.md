    Recovered in good condition.  The surrounding area is now a small park. The
    monument is situated in a landscaped flower bed. (Also reported projecting,
    at a height of 4 inches.)

    Despite the fact that this bench mark was reported found in 2005, it still
    felt like a long shot to me. I typically don't have high hopes for marks
    near old railroad tracks, especially when they're set in concrete posts. But
    Rich and I were pleased to see that a small park now exists at this site,
    and we were absolutely thrilled when we noticed the mark as the centerpiece
    of a small landscaped bed. It has the appearance of an enthroned queen! The
    disk is in excellent condition, and the post still projects about six inches
    and has received a coat of red paint sometime in the past few years. “Wow,”
    Rich kept saying, “I can't get over that!”
