    So close and yet so far! We're nearly sure that this mark is still in place,
    and Dad and I think we saw the boulder that it's set into, but a twenty foot
    wide “moat” of thick poison ivy prevented us from reaching it. Beyond the
    Evil Weed, the woods are open and easily hikeable, and the boulder is only a
    few dozen yards into the woods anyway. But we weren't about to risk a
    reaction, which I would surely get. Dad is still pretty sure that he's among
    the very small percentage of people who are immune, or at least resistant,
    to poison ivy, but he doesn't want to find out the hard way. I would love to
    try this one again, though, perhaps when there's a layer of snow on the
    ground, or with some preventive measures like grocery bags tied around my
    shoes.
