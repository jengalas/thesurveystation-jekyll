    For much of the year it's hard to imagine that a large boulder in a field just a few feet off the road could be a challenge to find. But once summer vegetation takes hold, what seemed a sure bet (either to find or to confirm that there is no longer such a boulder in the vicinity) is anything but. 


    34 M was such a mark for us today. After a slow start to the season the flora has caught up to its usual mid-June lushness, and everything is overgrown to a degree that was unimaginable even a few weeks ago. We spotted-just barely, amid the weeds-some rocks forming a headwall of the culvert, and a grass and brush covered hump a few feet to the east that may have been a boulder. Even the wooden posts from the old wire fence still line the road. It's very likely that the boulder, and the mark, are still here somewhere.


    But today, we had no chance at finding the boulder-and we were assuming that the boulder is large and projects significantly above the level of the ground. If it's flush with the ground, 34 M will be a tough find even in the colder seasons. We may try again!
