    Continuing along the route of the old Bicycle Path after finding both a
    boundary marker on a post (USA/USA/PVT) and the steps that connect the path
    to the Champlain North Ridge Trail, we found yet another boundary marker. 
    I'm not sure which was more exciting! (Well, I have to admit that finding
    and following the trail was more exciting. But the boundary monuments were a
    thrilling bonus!) This disk is stamped “USA/PVT” and while the disk appears
    to be in good condition, the granite post is leaning at a sharp angle. It
    does feel like it's set pretty securely in the ground, though.
