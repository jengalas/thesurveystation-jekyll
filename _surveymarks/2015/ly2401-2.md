    I first recovered this mark over twelve years ago. Rich wasn't with me that day, but he has been interested in seeing the mark and, of course, the viaduct! Dad had the idea to drive by today on our way to Bainbridge (and after having breakfast in Susquehanna). The stone viaduct is still in beautiful shape and quite an impressive landmark. Viaduct Street, which passes through one of the arches, was originally the Delaware & Hudson Railroad right-of-way, as is visible in the early 1900s postcard view. On this bleak, cold morning Rich was content to view the mark from the car as we passed slowly by, but I decided to get out and take a closer look. Meanwhile, Dad drove a little further to find a place where they could turn around safely, and then they returned to pick me up. The disk is still in good condition, although it has suffered slight corrosion.
