    This relatively new tidal bench mark disk is located at the west (Water
    Street) end of the main pier in Eastport. We visited Eastport on a Saturday,
    and a craft fair was underway near the pier. As you might expect, a table
    was set up nearly on top of the mark (this isn't the first time this has
    happened to us!). Fortunately we still had plenty of room to access and
    photograph the mark. The disk is in excellent condition and is easy to find
    in the north corner of the concrete pier abutment.
