    We returned to the Waymart area today to complete our loop of eight marks
    that we had prepared for last weekend. The first mark on our list was in
    Pleasant Mount, and our GPS routed us north through Clifford rather than
    through Waymart as we had expected. Along the way, I noticed this old
    concrete bridge with a PDH plaque. Rich pulled over, and Dad and I checked
    the wingwalls for benchmark disks. We didn't see anything obvious at first,
    but then I noticed the designation 96-35-1013-2 written on a metal plate
    fastened just above the southeastern wingwall. The wingwall was encrusted
    with mud and gravel, but we scraped it off and found a nice PDH survey disk
    hiding underneath. It's an old disk, but was stamped (we assume in 1996)
    with the modern PennDOT designation.
