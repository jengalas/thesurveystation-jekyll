    This range marker has to be one of the most unusual stations we've ever
    found! Apparently these markers were constructed in pairs to allow for
    sighting along a line and thereby locating points along the international
    boundary. We didn't search for the smaller (front) marker—I'm not even sure
    if it still exists or where it might be, but I don't think it's in the NGS
    database. After exploring “downtown” Eastport during the morning, we climbed
    Battery Hill behind the elementary school and walked right up to this
    station, a huge white pyramid. We took a series of photos of the east-facing
    side of the pyramid before walking around to the southwest-facing side and
    realizing that this was the side we should have been documenting! The
    southwest face is painted red and into the center is embedded a plaque that
    reads: UNITED STATES — RANGE MARK NO. 8 RANGING INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY
    COURSE 1-2 — TREATY OF 1908.
