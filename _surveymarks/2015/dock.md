    We spotted this Army Corps survey mark after a cruise with Dad to the
    Cranberry Isles. As we were heading off the pier toward the parking lot,
    Rich and I simultaneously noticed the disk. “You know what you have to do!”
    he said, referring to the usual documenting of the mark. We've been to
    Northeast Harbor plenty of times before and I thought we had checked the
    piers for benchmarks—but since this mark has apparently been in place since
    1979, I guess we just missed it. It's in excellent condition and is clearly
    stamped with the elevation in feet above Mean Low Water datum.
