    Our day trip to Eastport yielded a few interesting survey mark finds. Unfortunately this wasn't one of them. With adjusted coordinates to rely on, we figured this would be a simple find. We didn't count on the pier having been paved over! The mark may still be in place, but there's certainly no easy way to find it now.


    On the plus side, the mark is/was adjacent to Quoddy Bay Lobster, which we of course had to try. The jumbo lobster rolls earned our highest ratingâ€”eight hooves up!
