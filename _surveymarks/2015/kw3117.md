    This was the first of three marks we were able to find today at Capitol
    Park. It was bitterly, almost unbelievably cold but Rich's hands were steady
    enough that he could take a nice photo of the dome, as well as one of the
    smaller domes, from the sidewalk. The dome is surprisingly colorful,
    decorated in gold and spring green. We then took a very brief tour through
    the park to locate [PTS 30](/surveymarks/kw0855/) and [L 3](/surveymarks/kw0854/).
