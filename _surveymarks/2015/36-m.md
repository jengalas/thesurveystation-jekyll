    It's time to mow the fields! We're not going to attempt the search for 36 M
    in major tick habitat like this high, heavy grass. We suspect that the disk
    may be on the only large, prominent boulder in this field, although the rock
    looks flakier than the type that typically makes for a good bench mark
    setting.  Like 33 M, 36 M may be set in a less prominent but more
    substantial nearby boulder, nearly flush with the ground. Either way, we'll
    wait until the grass is cut, or until wintertime, to try again.
