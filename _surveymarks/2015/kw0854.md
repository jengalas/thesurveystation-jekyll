    Our final find of the day was such an interesting discovery! The disk itself
    is a typical bench mark disk from 1929, but the large monument into which
    it's set is really special. Into the north face of the sandstone monument is
    carved “U. S. Coast Survey, Sept. 1877” and the latitude and longitude as
    determined by the instruments of the day. The top of the monument is divided
    into quadrants by shallow grooves (I'm not sure why) and the benchmark disk
    is set into what would be Cartesian Quadrant II to anyone facing the carved
    side of the monument. The monument is adjacent to the Mexican War Monument,
    a prominent sculpture in Capitol Park. The sandstone monument and the
    benchmark disk are both in very good condition, especially for being in such
    an exposed location.
