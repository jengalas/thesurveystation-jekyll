    This was the first of the “two-fer” marks we found at the southeastern end of Wyalusing's 4-span truss bridge crossing the Susquehanna. An auspicious “BM 680” on the topo map indicated that there is (or was) a bench mark in this spot, but without a description we had little to go on. 


    When we arrived at the coordinates, Rich let out a hoot-“Hey, look at this! Two disks!” There were indeed two disks set in close proximity at the southeastern wingwall. One was the USGS mark indicated on the topo map, and the other was this one, a new (2013) PennDOT disk. It's in good condition and is otherwise unremarkable, but how exciting it was to find two marks for the “price” of one!"
