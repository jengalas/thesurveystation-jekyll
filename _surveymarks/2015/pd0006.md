    Tidal bench marks are always fun to find. They are typically set in a group
    of five to ten marks in pretty close proximity to one another, so if you're
    diligent you can often find several at once. Also, they often have only
    scaled coordinates on the datasheets, which makes them more of a challenge
    to track down. This mark, and TIDAL 2 just about 120 feet away, were
    unusually easy to locate since they're set on the property of prominent
    buildings on Water Street.  TIDAL 3 is set in the granite balustrade lining
    the south edge of the steps to the Peavey Library. The mark is slightly worn
    but is in good condition with legible stamping.
