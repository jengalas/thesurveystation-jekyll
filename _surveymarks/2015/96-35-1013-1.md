    This was the second of two PennDOT marks we found this morning on our way to
    search for three USGS marks in the Waymart area. (It's a good thing we
    happened to notice these marks, because they were the only ones we found all
    day. We struck out on all of the USGS marks.)  The mark is a new-style
    PennDOT survey control mark set into the eastern bannister of a bridge over
    a branch of Dundaff Creek.
