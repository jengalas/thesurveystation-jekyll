    This is another old PDH disk found unintentionally, as they so often are,
    when we just happened to see an old concrete bridge and check its wingwalls.
    This one is stamped with a relatively new designation following PennDOT's
    code ({year} - {county code} - {route number} - {disk number in line}). It
    also happens to be very close to two neat old buildings: the Stonewall Inn,
    which is mentioned in the description of nearby [33 M](/surveymarks/33-m/), and the O. C. Miller House. I'm not sure
    who he was or what the property is now used for, but it was a fun find. The
    disk and bridge appear to be in good condition.
