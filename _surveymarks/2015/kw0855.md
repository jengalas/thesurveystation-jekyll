    After viewing the capitol dome from the street and taking our photos, we
    entered the park to look for this primary traverse station. Initially we
    were concerned when we saw the fenced-off area near the south corner of the
    building, but fortunately the fence stops a few inches short of the disk and
    we were able to access it. While Rich and Dad hopped around trying to get
    warm, I took my photos (quickly, because my fingers froze immediately when I
    removed my gloves in order to operate the camera). The disk is in excellent
    condition and is set into the south corner of the southwest face of the
    Speaker Matthew J. Ryan Building.
