    At first, this mark seemed like a long shot. This long, frozen-solid, snowy winter has produced several-foot-high icebergs along every road in northern Pennsylvania. I was hoping that the further south we went we'd see less snow, but Harrisburg obviously wasn't nearly far enough south. 


    As we turned onto Indiantown Gap Road and I looked over toward where I expected to find the culvert, I really wasn't surprised to see <em>yet another</em> wall of dirty ice studded with gravel. The culvert's location was marked with the typical red posts. While Rich stayed toasty warm in the car, probably thinking we were crazy (and we are), Dad and I went out in windy 2-degree weather to check out the culvert.  To our complete shock, the disk was miraculously exposed in a gap beneath an overhang of frozen filth! 


    The disk is scratched but stable with a legible designation. It is set in the top of a concrete culvert in the south corner of Fisher Ave (Rt. 934) and Indiantown Gap Road.
