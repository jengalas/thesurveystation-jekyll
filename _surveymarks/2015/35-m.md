    When Rich and I investigated this mark yesterday on Google Maps, we could
    see that the Creamton Road bridge over the Lackawaxen was relatively new.
    There's always a chance that a new bridge deck was placed on top of the old
    abutments, but that's not what happened here, as we discovered once we
    reached the site.  The entire structure is new. In fact, Dad remembers
    having driven by when the bridge was under construction nearly ten years
    ago. He showed where the temporary bridge had spanned the river—barely a
    mark is left now among the weeds. There's no sign of 35 M, which was likely
    removed along with the old abutments. A new PennDOT mark (06F-63-0247-4) is
    now set in the bridge bannister, in the northwest corner of the bridge.
