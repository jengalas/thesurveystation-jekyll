    While wandering around on top of the Eastport bluff known as Battery Hill,
    Rich and I came across this vertical control mark. We hadn't known about it
    in advanceâ€”we later found out that it's not in the NGS database, even though
    it is an NGS disk, which explains our ignorance of it. Now the question is:
    where is the data? Was the mark set but not surveyed? It is not stamped with
    a date but appears to be a relatively new mark in good condition.
