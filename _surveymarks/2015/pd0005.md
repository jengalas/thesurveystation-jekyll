    This tidal bench mark disk is an easy find on the granite balustrade lining
    the south side of the steps to the old Frontier National Bank building on
    Water Street. It is not clear whether the building still houses the police
    station, as was reported in the most recent (2009) NGS recovery. There is no
    longer police insignia on the door, and I spotted a “For Rent” sign in one
    of the windows. The disk is in very good condition with legible stamping.
