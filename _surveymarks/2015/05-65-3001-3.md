    Laceyville's Church Street Bridge received the American Institute of Steel Construction's “most beautiful bridge” award in 1975. That sounds like an impressive accomplishment for a bridge in such a small, relatively remote village, but the structure really is stunning. The turquoise-painted open-grate bridge is obviously well maintained, and it has a gracefully curving deck. 


    While I investigated the kayak launch site on the riverbank just west of the bridge, Rich stayed near the bridge to take some photos. When I returned, he pointed out this mark to me. It's an old PDT mark that has recently been stamped with a modern PennDOT designation. The disk is in good condition.
