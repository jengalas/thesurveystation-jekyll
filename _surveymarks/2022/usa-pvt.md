    I spotted this boundary marker while I was poking around south of the Triad, looking for any sign of the lower Van Santvoord Trail other than the set of steps that is obvious from the carriage road (I didn't find anything much). But it was fun to find this marker, even though it is on a very steep and slippery slope above a creekbed and is probably not very stable. I also spotted a maritime garter snake very close to this boundary marker.
