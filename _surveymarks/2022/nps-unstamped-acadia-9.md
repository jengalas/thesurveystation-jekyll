    While exploring the west side of Lake Wood today, we followed an old woods
    road (which is likely to be a bridle path, actually) west from the parking
    area near the lake, unsure where it went or what we might find along the
    way. After just about a quarter mile, we encountered the park boundary and
    this “Acadia Boundary” monument. It is unstamped, so I don't know the date
    it was set or even have a designation to identify it. The boundary is shared
    with a horse farm and is well posted. We followed the boundary line
    northeast and found a few smaller, local surveyor's marks, but no other NPS
    disks marking the boundary as far as we could see. This disk is in good
    condition (it looks quite new).
