    I was in Harrisburg today for a conference at the Hilton. After my presentation, I escaped to de-stress by looking for a few benchmarks. After finding an unexpected benchmark set in the sidewalk along Walnut Street, I made my way to the Dauphin County Courthouse as planned.
    
    
    I wasn't sure what to expect, but as soon as I arrived I had a sinking feeling, based on the description, that the disk would be located very near, and likely beneath, the three large recycling bins I saw in the corner of the portico. The courthouse was quite busy this afternoon, but I squeezed behind the recycling bins anyway. I brushed away a significant amount of leaf litter, and eventually spotted the disk partially obscured by the bins!  I wasn't about to try to move them, given the circumstances. But I was able to read the designation and determine that the disk was in good condition. Unfortunately I only had my phone with me, hence the poor quality photos.
    
    
    If it hadn't been such a cold, blustery day, I would have searched for a few more marks in the area. As it was, I was hungry and headed immediately to MASA on 2nd and Barbara St. for tacos and agua fresca. I can highly recommend it, in addition to Anna Rose Bakery on 2nd and Walnut St.!
