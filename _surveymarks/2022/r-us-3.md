    Today was a good day for boundary monuments along the Seaside Path! This was
    the third R/US disk we found, and the fourth disk overall (the first had no
    stamping, but otherwise appeared very similar to this one). They are all in
    fair to good condition. An adjacent witness post makes this monument hard to
    miss.
