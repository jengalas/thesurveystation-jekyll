    Just as we were leaving Bucksport this morning, I spotted a disk on a bridge
    bannister. Rich pulled down into another small parking lot along the
    waterfront trail and waited while I photographed the disk, which was a
    MaineDOT mark from 2021. I haven't yet been able to find any more
    information about this disk.
