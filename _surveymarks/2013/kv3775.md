    This spire was an easy find, most welcome after poking around in the mud and
    thorns at nearby ELEPHANT.  Even on a Sunday, this was a peaceful location. 
    We must have been too late to encounter any churchgoers.  The scene was
    bright and colorful with the flowers of early spring—daffodils and grape
    hyacinth—circling the perimeter of the stone church and accentuating the
    stained glass windows.  The church dates to 1743 and has an [interesting
    history](https://www.lightjourney.org/detail.asp?z=history&x=spucctp).
