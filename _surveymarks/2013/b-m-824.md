    This bolt was much easier to find than B. M. 825 just a few yards away. 
    (Rich spotted this one first, too.)  It's set in the top step/platform just
    to the left (north) of the Fifth Avenue entrance to St. Patrick's
    Cathedral.  It was a real thrill to see the carved “B M”, still in excellent
    condition, from the NYBE+A survey a century ago. Hundreds if not thousands
    of people passed by in the few minutes we spent at the cathedral, but I'd be
    surprised if any of them noticed this bolt.  Hopefully it will remain in
    good shape for at least the next hundred years.
