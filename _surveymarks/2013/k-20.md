    Our first goal for this rainy Sunday was to seek out a USGS BM, K 20, near the intersection of Route 3 and Cooksey Drive.  The USGS description was incomplete, and I think we'd driven by once before to scout the location, only to find that the situation was near hopeless with the paltry information provided on the old datasheet.  However, this year I noticed a new recovery for this mark entered into the MDOT database.  It contained a revised description and coordinates provided by Patriot Land Surveys in Bar Harbor.  
    
    
    We entered the wooded triangle between the two roads.  Fortunately, it's mostly open woods that were easy to navigate, even when everything was wet.  It took a few minutes of tromping southwest from our starting point, but soon enough we spotted pink flagging tape and a standard USGS metal witness sign on a tree. 
    
    
    The mark was found in excellent condition and very solid in its setting on the outcrop.  We also found a MAG nail set into a rock a few yards away, with some pink flagging tape attached, and some pink flagging tape tied to the nearest guardrail post along Route 3.
