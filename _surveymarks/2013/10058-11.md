    This MaineDOT station is set into the earthen pier on the property of the
    Bagaduce Lunch.  The disk is small and was nearly buried in the grass, so it
    was a challenge to find.  Rich eventually spotted it during our walk along
    the pier.  The disk appears to be in good condition.  We were unable to find
    any evidence of the PK nail in the western-most pile of the pier.
