    This is one of those nondescript marks that are so cool simply because they're nondescript: most people wouldn't have the slightest idea what they were for, even if they did happen to notice that small copper bolt at the corner of the library entrance steps. Through survey mark hunting, Rich and I are clued in on these little infrastructure “secrets” hidden in plain sight!


    This bolt was described in “[Precise Leveling in New York City](/assets/docs/publications/Precise_Leveling_in_New_York_City.pdf)” by Frederick W. Koop, published in 1914 (surveyed 1909-1912). As mentioned in the official description, the bolt is as follows:


    `NOTE 5: A bench mark of this type is the top of a copper bolt 3 inches long, leaded vertically in masonry. It is usually set flush with the surface, but at times slightly above it. The letters B.M. are stamped on the top as shown: [illustration of bolt with B M stamped in a column, with a point punch in the middle]`


    Unfortunately we couldnt't find any evidence of the stamped B M. We assumed that the bolt has been worn smooth by all the foot traffic over the past 100 years!
