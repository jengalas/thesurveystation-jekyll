    I think I actually squealed when I read the description for this mark. “There's a bench mark on one of the lions in front of the library! _One of the lions!!!_” I exclaimed to Rich. He was excited too, although maybe not quite to that level. It was the first mark to go on the list for our New York City “benchmarks & bumming around” daytrip.
    
    
    As expected, we found the cut **T** very easily in the north face of the base of the northernmost of two lion sculptures. (I think this particular lion's name is Fortitude.) The mark is surrounded by a square of yellow paint or chalk. Could it still be in use? It's in the NGS database, so it's likely that modern surveyors are using it. This mark is yet another hidden treasure in the big city!
