    Mark not found. It was removed when the bridge was replaced. There is a new
    PennDOT survey control disk set in the top of the east barrier of the
    bridge, but this is not W 278.

    On our way home from buying flowers at nearby Jerry's For All Seasons, Rich
    and I stopped on the Reeves Street bridge to sort out the truth about this
    mark.  Six geocachers have logged this mark “found,” while the NGS history
    clearly states that it was destroyed when the old bridge was replaced in
    2002. We discovered that the disk  currently set into the east sidewall of
    the bridge is **not** W 278.  It is a modern, unstamped [PennDOT survey disk](/surveymarks/penndot-unstamped-1/). Although
    the original description does not make it clear whether W 278 was in the
    northern or southern end of the old bridge, this disk is almost certainly
    not in the same location or at the same elevation as W 278.
