    This drill hole could be challenging to find because it is small, blends in
    quite easily with the surrounding rock, and the triangle is shallowly
    chiseled.  The to-reach and description are accurate and precise, however;
    once in the area we discovered that there were only two possible locations
    to check.  The location of this mark is indicated by a painted "10" on the
    street, similar to what we found at [16718-11](/surveymarks/16718-11/)
    nearby (although at that station, the entire designation was painted on the
    street).
