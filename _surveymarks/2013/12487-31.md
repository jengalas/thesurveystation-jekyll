    This recently monumented station is in excellent condition and was located
    exactly as described.  It is set into the sidewalk just south of the Kids'
    Corner daycare on Route 3 (Mt. Desert Street).  It was a short walk just
    around the corner from our hotel—but not necessarily an easy walk, as I'd
    just hurt my knees in a fall after recovering POR 1944!
