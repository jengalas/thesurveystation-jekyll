    This was the second of three marks I found set in very close proximity to
    one another in the lawn just southeast of Old Main.  Sheli waited for me as
    I recovered the mark while Sharon, Betsey, Vince, Narda, and Joe went on
    ahead to grab us a table at the Corner Room.  The disk is in good condition.
