    Egg Rock Lighthouse is an active lighthouse currently maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge.  It is situated on Egg Rock in Frenchman Bay, easily visible from the Park Loop Road in Acadia National Park, but best viewed from the bay. The lighthouse was built in 1875. In 1902, it was established as a Coast & Geodetic Survey landmark station.
