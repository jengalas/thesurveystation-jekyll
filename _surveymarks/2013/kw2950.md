    This was the first of five marks I found while visiting Penn State today
    with my colleagues.  I spotted this one as soon as we turned from Fischer
    Rd.  into the parking garage, and I took a quick photo as we walked from the
    garage to the library.  This building has an interesting history.  It was
    built in 1936-1937 as a Biomechanics Teaching Laboratory.  See [Penn
    State University Park Campus History Collection > Water Tower](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/psuimages/id/4534/rec/2) for building plans, specifications, historical information, and more
    photographs.
