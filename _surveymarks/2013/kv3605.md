    While we sipped our ale and nibbled on pub fare at the Brew Works in Bethlehem, Rich had the excellent idea to check [BenchMap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tsqmadness.bmmaps) for any nearby benchmarks we might be able to find before heading to the film festival at Northampton Community College.  I knew there were no disks nearby, but I was pleased to see that at least there was a landmark station within easy walking distance.
    
    
    Dad was most agreeable to the plan, so we took a quick stroll to the corner of E. Market St. and School St.  We actually spotted the spire from several blocks away.  It appears to be in good condition and is undoubtedly the same spire observed in 1885.  The cornerstone of the church indicates its date of establishment as 1869.  The church is now called Christ Church UCC.
