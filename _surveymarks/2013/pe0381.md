    The first tidal mark we targeted at Fort Point was TIDAL 30 STA 30.  It is
    supposed to be set in a large 8' x 5' x 4' (i.e., un-missable!) boulder near
    the bluff.  The trail from the lighthouse doesn't really seem to exist
    anymore, or at least not in the sense that it did when it was described in
    1948.  Still, we figured if we followed the bluff we would eventually spot
    this huge boulder.  We reached the beach without spotting even a single
    likely candidate.  Perhaps the fact that it was high tide during our visit
    played a part; next year, if the tides cooperate, it may be advisable to
    walk along the beach instead of the bluff to attempt to spot the large
    boulder.
