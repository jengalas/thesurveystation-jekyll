    This was the third of three marks I found set in very close proximity to one
    another in the lawn just southeast of Old Main.  Sheli waited for me as I
    recovered the mark while Sharon, Betsey, Vince, Narda, and Joe went on ahead
    to grab us a table at the Corner Room.  Despite being covered by mud at the
    time of my visit, the disk seems solid in its setting and is in good
    condition.
