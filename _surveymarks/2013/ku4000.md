    Today's long walk around the city wrapped up with a stroll through Central
    Park, where we found one of the original Manhattan survey bolts and a few
    nearby landmark stations. This large apartment-hotel, The Sherry-Netherland,
    was one of the landmarks. Built in 1927 in the Romanesque Revival and Gothic
    Revival styles, it was the tallest apartment-hotel in New York City when it
    opened. A previous building on the site, the Hotel New Netherland, burned in
    a spectacular fire in 1927 while it was already undergoing demolition.
    Although the building referred to in the datasheet description is not named,
    it must have been the current building because it was first observed in
    1932.
