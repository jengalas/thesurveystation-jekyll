    This was the first of three marks I found set in very close proximity to one
    another in the lawn just southeast  of Old Main.  Sheli waited for me as I
    recovered the mark while Sharon, Betsey, Vince, Narda, and Joe went on ahead
    to grab us a table at the Corner Room.  The disk is in good condition.
