    We came across this disk, and another related one nearby, after locating the lower portion of the abandoned Goat Trail near Jordan Pond. While we were counting coping stones on our way back to the Bubble Rock parking area as another way (in addition to GPS) of locating the handrail down to the old trail, we spotted these disks. They are labeled “Vista Management Area.” Both disks are in good condition, although being set on rods, I don't know how long they will last or how precise their positioning is meant to be.
