    For now, this one has completely stumped us.  If we arrive near low tide next year, we may try to spot this boulder from the beach.  We walked along the entire bluff twice and could not find a single boulder fitting the description.
    
    
    The NOS description, which differs from the NGS description, is as follows:
    
    
    The bench mark is a drill hole on the top of a 3 m x 2 m (10 ft x 8 ft) boulder projecting 2.1 m (7 ft) above the level of the beach and surrounded by water at high tide, about 274 m (900 ft) NW along the waters' edge from the end of the trail leading to the lighthouse, 165 m (540 ft) NW of bench mark NO 30 1948, 59.4 m (195.0 ft) SE of the inshore end of an old wharf, and 22.9 m (75.0 ft) NW of the north bank of Cape Jellison.
