    Recovered in good condition as described. One World Trade Center surpassed
    the height of the Empire State Building in April 2012 and is now the tallest
    building in the city.

    What can we say about the Empire State Building? It's still there! It seems
    silly to “recover” this landmark station, and I know most landmark stations
    are no longer valuable from a surveying perspective, but they're some of the
    most historically interesting marks. This one's description has taken a
    poignant turn as the Empire State Building regained its stature as the
    tallest building in the city after the fall of the World Trade Center towers
    in 2001, and then lost it again once One World Trade Center was completed in
    2012.
