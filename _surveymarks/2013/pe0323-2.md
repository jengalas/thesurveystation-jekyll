    Today we attempted another search for Q 145.  We had renewed hope after noticing a 2002 recovery in the MDOT database, and slightly different coordinates on their datasheet.  But we were still unable to find the large boulder, even with the revised coordinates!
    
    
    We had targeted a probable location further west along Pretty Marsh Road/Route 102 than the NGS coordinates. We primarily chose this location because it could be “123 feet northwest of the northwest corner” of a house, as mentioned in the NGS description.  (The house in question is the only house in the vicinity on the south side of Route 102.  The mark is supposed to be on the north side of the road, but the given dimensions lead us to conclude that the house must be south of the road.) However, in this wooded area we could find only one outcrop that might possibly make sense, and it was completely covered with a layer of thick soggy moss and pine debris. If the mark is set into this outcrop, it will have to wait for a drier day!
