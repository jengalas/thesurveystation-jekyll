    On our way home from shopping in Dunmore, Rich and I stopped at the Reeves
    Street bridge to see if we could clear up the confusion over [W 278](/surveymarks/ly1589/) (LY1589). Over the past few years
    several geocachers have logged this NGS mark as Found, but their photos all
    showed a PennDOT disk instead of an NGS disk. We discovered that they were
    indeed finding and logging the wrong disk. We could find no sign of W 278,
    and a 2002 recovery from PennDOT on the official datasheet confirms that W
    278 was removed when the bridge was replaced.  It's not clear when this
    unstamped disk was set.
