    We were wandering around the city, on our way to Kusmi Tea's Upper East Side
    shop on 3rd Avenue, when Rich spotted this unusual disk in the sidewalk at
    the west corner of the intersection of Lexington Ave. and 56th Street. We
    didn't know anything about it at the time, but an Internet search indicates
    that this mark was set for the East Side Access Projectâ€”a megaproject with
    the goal of bringing Long Island Railroad trains to Grand Central Terminal.
    The projected completion date is December 2022. There are probably other
    MTA-ESA marks to find nearby!
