    Rich and I spotted this mark after stopping at a farm stand just up the road
    (“The Great Produce Experience” on Rt. 438—and their tomatoes and peaches
    _have_ been fantastic). This bridge, built over the past year, replaced
    a bridge on which an old USGS mark had been set.  Unfortunately I never
    searched for that mark, but I had been wondering whether PennDOT would set a
    new mark in the new bridge.  They did!  The disk is in new condition and, as
    yet, has not been stamped.  It may not even have been surveyed yet.  This is
    one to keep an eye on.  (Good thing we'll still be in the area to buy more
    tomatoes and peaches, at least as long as the nice summer weather lasts!)
