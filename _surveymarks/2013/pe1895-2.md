    During today's hike to both summits of Acadia Mountain, we made a quick search for ROBINSON MOUNTAIN 1870 (which we had found in 2006, but we didn't recall it having been such a struggle to get to then)!  We eventually made our way to the correct ledge—peaceful location overlooking Somes Sound—and found all three marks still in perfect condition. The triangulation station is off the trail and requires some light bushwhacking to reach it.
