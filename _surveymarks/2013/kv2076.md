    This was the first of several survey marks we had in mind to search for
    after our hike at nearby Lake Nockamixon.  The disk is in excellent
    condition and set exactly as described.  The church is now called St.
    Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church.  My father particularly liked the
    picturesque setting of this mark.  Rich and I were glad that we didn't have
    to go digging in the bushes to find it!
