    This bench mark disk set on the New York Public Library was our first stop
    on today's laid-back tour of midtown.  We easily identified the north corner
    of the library building but didn't spot the bench mark immediately.  A quick
    peek behind the shrubbery was all it took.  It was a bit more difficult to
    maneuver for a photo, but Rich was able to manage it.  The disk is in
    excellent condition, well protected and probably not in danger of being
    damaged or moved.
