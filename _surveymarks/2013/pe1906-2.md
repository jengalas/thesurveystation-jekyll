    Today Rich and I took the (new) Goat Trail to the summit of Norumbega Mountain, formerly known as Brown Mountain. We spent some time relaxing at the summit, and then decided to check on the BROWN MOUNTAIN triangulation station to ensure that the marks are still in good condition. The station mark (a copper bolt) and both reference mark disks are in good condition, just as they were when we found them in 2006. We took the Hadlock Ponds trail back to the parking area.
