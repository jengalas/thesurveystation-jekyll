    We recovered this station a year later than we could have.  I recall noticing it when we first visited Fort Point last year and entertaining the thought that it might be an NGS station.  Why I didn't take a photo of it then, just in case, I don't know.  But this year I was prepared.
    
    
    The station consists of a red daybeacon atop a tapered stone base.  It is listed in Special Publication #46: [Geodesy: Triangulation in Maine](/assets/docs/publications/Geodesy-in-Maine.pdf), by Walter F. Reynolds (1918).  The publication indicates that observations on the beacon were taken in 1911.
