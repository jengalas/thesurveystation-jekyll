    We were thrilled to discover that there were two survey marks on the
    property of the Bagaduce Lunch.  We had wanted to try the famous haddock
    sandwich anyway, and having survey marks so close by made this a necessary
    stop.  The haddock sandwich (and onion rings and lobster roll) were
    delicious, and we found both marks quite easily.  WO 33 is set into a large
    rock outcrop in the picnic area just west of the lunch stand.  It is in very
    good condition with all stamping clearly legible.
