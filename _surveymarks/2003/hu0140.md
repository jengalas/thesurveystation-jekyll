    This benchmark disk was found as described in the west end of the north
    bridge bannister. The bridge has been painted white and the number “427” is
    painted on the eastern end of the bannister. The mark appears to be in good
    condition; the stamping is legible although much of the disk is covered with
    white paint. The historic description is reliable, though the following
    additional information may be useful: the bridge is just southeast of the
    southeast corner of the Millville Town Hall, near the intersection of Route
    26 and Club House Road. The Lord Baltimore High School is now the Lord
    Baltimore Elementary School.
