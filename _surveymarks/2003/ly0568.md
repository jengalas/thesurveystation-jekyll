    After locating [LY0567](/surveymarks/ly0567/) on the southeast
    side of the county courthouse, we walked right around to the northeast side
    and found this one. There was no shrubbery to contend with. The marker is
    set horizontally on a small ledge just beneath the windows. It's in very
    good condition.
