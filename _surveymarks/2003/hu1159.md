    This survey disk was found as described approximately 11 feet northwest of
    the northwest corner of American Legion Post 166 in Ocean City. The mark was
    reached easily using the historic description, and no changes are necessary.
    Note that south of 32nd Street, Route 528 is known as Philadelphia Avenue.
    At the mark, I recorded coordinates that are approximately 53 feet from the
    scaled coordinates given on the datasheet. The disk is flush with the
    surface of the ground and appears to be in very good condition with all
    stamping clearly legible.
