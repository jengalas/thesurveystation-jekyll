    This horizontal control disk was found easily using the 1991 description; no
    changes are necessary. The mark appears to be in excellent condition, and
    the concrete monument holding the disk is painted bright yellow. At the
    station my Garmin eTrex receiver indicated 13.9 feet from the datasheet
    coordinates. Note: this station is a Cooperative Base Network Control
    Station.
