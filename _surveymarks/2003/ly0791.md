    While cruising around in the area after an extremely pleasant day of
    mountain biking at Blue Mountain Lake, Rich asked “Do you want to find a
    benchmark?” Of course I did, so he parked at the school and checked to see
    if he still had the coordinates in his GPSr. He didn't, so he then checked
    his binder full of printouts to see if he had the datasheet. I didn't find
    out if he had it, because I located the mark just a few seconds after
    getting out of the car. It's on a crumbling monument about one meter from a
    utility pole in the front yard of the Sandyston Walpack School. The mark is
    in very good condition and the designation is legible.

    On this gorgeous, sunny, mid-Fall morning I was hunting a Geocache in Stokes State Forest. While driving back to Port Jervis I had plenty of time to search for this benchmark, which was located along NJ Rte 560 just east of Layton. I found it easily using the historic description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 310 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is in excellent condition and the designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
