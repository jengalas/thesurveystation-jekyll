    This mark is located near the intersection of Route 171 and East Church
    Street (the “paved road leading southwest” mentioned in the description). It
    was fortunate that I needed to turn around and pulled up onto East Church
    Street in order to do so; it was then that I happened to notice the NGS
    witness post. The mark was easy to find following the description as it's
    located less than three feet northeast of the post. The “Welcome to
    Susquehanna” sign no longer exists, but the rusting supports are still in
    place and also served to help locate the station. The utility pole still
    exists and is numbered 4S-355. The station is a rod inside a pipe with an
    access hatch; the hatch is flush with the surface of the ground. The station
    appears to be in good condition. At the site, my GPS receiver indicated
    coordinates approximately 90 feet from the coordinates given on the
    datasheet.
