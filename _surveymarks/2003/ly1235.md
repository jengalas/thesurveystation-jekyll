    We traveled north along Decker Hollow Road (past the site of the elusive LY1233 - X 235) to Kimbles to continue our search for the 235 series marks. This mark required no searching. As described, it's set in the northwest wingwall of the north abutment of a concrete bridge along T495, less than 200 feet south-southeast of the intersection of Decker Hollow Road and T495. The mark is in good condition with legible stamping.

    **Recovered in good condition.**


    This second order vertical control station is set in the top of the northwest wingwall for the north abutment of a bridge along Hendershot Road (T495) which spans Decker Creek. The historical description leads reliably to the station. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 51 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
