    This benchmark was found as described except that the stamping indicates
    “Reset 1936” instead of “Reset 1935”. The disk is in good condition, and the
    description led directly to the site. In the third photo, Linden Street can
    be seen in front of the Valley Masonic Hall, while Berry Street runs along
    the Hall's southwest edge.
