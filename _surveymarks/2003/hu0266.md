    This triangulation station disk was found as described on the seawall at the
    southernmost edge of Ocean City. It was located easily using the historic
    descriptions. The Coast Guard tower [Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum](http://www.ocmuseum.org/))
    and the municipal parking lot are still in existence, while the witness post
    was not recovered. The posted coordinates were approximately 11.8 feet from
    the coordinates I recorded at the site. The disk is in good condition and
    the date and designation are legible; it appears that someone may have
    attempted to make the “1956” more visible.
