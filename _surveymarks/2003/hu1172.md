    This benchmark disk was found on the east side of the concrete foundation of
    the 15th Street water tank ([HU1252](/surveymarks/hu1252/))
    adjacent to Ocean City Volunteer Fire Company Headquarters. It was located
    with ease using the historic description; no changes are necessary. The disk
    is in fair condition. It appears worn, but the date and designation can
    still be read.
