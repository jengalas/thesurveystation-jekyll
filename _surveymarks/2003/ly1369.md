    The historic description leads directly to this mark. Convenient parking can
    be found at the nearby Sabatini's restaurant along Routes 6&11 in
    Chinchilla. The mark is easy to access and to locate, as both the bridge and
    the pipes now running behind the bridge (and over the disk) are marked with
    “BM” in yellow paint. The disk is in very good condition.
