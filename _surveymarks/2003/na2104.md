    The post and cupola are in good condition atop the Otesaga Hotel. The  hotel
    was established in 1909 and has owned the property ever since, but during
    the off season from 1920 to 1954 the building housed the Knox School.

    This building is actually the beautiful Otesaga Hotel (and has been since it
    was built in 1909). During the off-season from 1920 till 1954, it housed the
    Knox School for Girls. Aaron and I walked over in the rain and spotted the
    cupola immediately; this landmark is obviously in fine shape. Then we took
    the brick path all the way around the back to see the lake and the golf
    course. This spot would be truly gorgeous on a sunny summer day.
