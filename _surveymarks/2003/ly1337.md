    I spotted this tower on my way to an appointment this morning, and thought
    “That would be a good spot for a benchmark.” I guess I was right! Of course,
    when I went back later in the evening to look, I couldn't find the disk.
    Aaron and I searched all around the base of the tower but there was no
    evidence that a disk had ever been there. It's possible that there may have
    been a concrete platform that extended out from the sides of the tower, on
    which the benchmark disk was placed; if this ever existed, it's been
    removed.
