    (What a hoot!) After a day of biking with friends at a nearby state park,
    Rich and I decided we had enough energy left to attempt to locate this
    marker. No signs warned us not to enter the area, though our choice of a
    parking spot may have been somewhat risky. Fortunately there were no goofy
    cops around to bother us, and we were left in peace to enjoy the sights and
    sounds of traffic rushing by below us on Route 80. We climbed to the summit
    of this landscaped area (it's not as dramatic as it sounds) and located the
    mark easily, mostly due to the presence of a witness post less than two feet
    to the south. A mat of soil and grass is already encroaching on the mark,
    but it's in good condition and the stamping can be read. The description is
    accurate.

    While returning from a mountain biking expedition in the south section of
    Allamuchy Mountain S.P. it was a relatively easy process to stop along the
    curve of the entrance ramp just before getting onto I-80 west and look for
    this horizontal control station. The historic description leads reliably to
    the mark and there is even a surveyor's stake with flagging to indicate the
    immediate location. At the station mark my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver
    indicated 18.8 feet from the posted coordinates. The disk is in very good
    condition and the stamped designation is quite legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
