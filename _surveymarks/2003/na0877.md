    This benchmark was located as described and is in very good condition. I
    wonder if this might have been one of the series of 1898 'Albany' disks;
    it's very similar in style to [NA1433](/surveymarks/na1433/).
    This is possible since the courthouse was constructed in 1880. It was a wet
    day in Cooperstown, but benchmark hunting is fun in all conditions.
