    Aaron and I took a little hike today with the goal of finding the station
    “High Knob” and its associated markers. While we didn't have great luck with
    that one, the lookout tower was found as described in good condition. A neat
    surprise was that the tower was in use today by a DCNR employee.

    This third order horizontal control station is located on the summit of High Knob in a section of Delaware State Forest near Pecks Pond. The historical description leads reliably to the lookout tower, which is still used by Pennsylvania DCNR for fire watches. It is roughly 195 feet southwest of triangulation station LY2678.
