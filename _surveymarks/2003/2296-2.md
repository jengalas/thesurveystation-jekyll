    We'd crossed the Market Street
    Bridge in Wilkes-Barre with the intention of locating [LY1434](/surveymarks/ly1434/). The
    problem was not in locating the marker (the description is very specific)
    but in uncovering it! We'd kicked at the snow and ice for a few minutes, not
    getting very far, when a construction worker behind us tossed us his shovel.
    Another helpful worker, after seeing what we were uncovering, pointed out
    that there was another benchmark on a little building (we're still not sure
    what it is) nearby. We climbed over to the building as he had suggested and
    found not just one, but two benchmarks in that area. The other is designated [MARKET](/surveymarks/market/).
