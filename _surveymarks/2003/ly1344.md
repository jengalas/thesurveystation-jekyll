    This was the first stop on this Sunday's up-valley benchmark bike tour. Rich
    and I rode from his house down to the tracks, where we picked up this mark
    and a few others, and then we worked our way over toward Archbald, Jermyn
    and Mayfield via the River Trail and the roads. This was my first experience
    locating a chiseled cross mark. It was tricky to see, but even harder to
    photograph! Still, it's in good condition for having been carved so long ago
    and probably exposed for many years. Rich's description is accurate.

    This vertical control station is about 1/3 mile east-northeast of the intersection of the D&H railroad and Hill St. in Jessup, or 2/3 mile west and southwest from the intersection of the D&H railroad and Breaker St. in Winton. The historic description is confusing with regard to the cardinal compass directions at the site. A chiseled cross is located in the extreme west corner of the top surface of the south parapet of a stone arch culvert over Grassy Island Creek. At the station mark my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 73.3 feet from the NGS datasheet coordinates. The mark was buried under a layer of packed dirt and is fairly well defined ... after 69 years!
