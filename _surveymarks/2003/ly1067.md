    Apparently this benchmark is treated like royalty! It's on a stone in a very
    prominent location on the square just as described, and it's surrounded by
    four taller monuments whose purpose is unknown to me. The disk is in
    excellent condition. It was a chilly day, but the rain held off while we
    were exploring this beautifully maintained park.
