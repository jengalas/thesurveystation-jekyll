    After pulling a nearby geocache from its hiding spot early this Monday
    morning, Rich and I decided to take the cache up to a bench on the levee to
    examine the contents and take photos. Imagine my surprise when this marker
    appeared at my feet!  Most likely this marker was placed as a part of the
    Army Corps of Engineers' Wyoming Valley project.
