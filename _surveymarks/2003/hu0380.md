    I'm pretty sure I've found this markâ€”or where it used to be. The
    description, such as it is, checks out and the concrete post obviously once
    held a disk since the stem remains. It's not 100% certain that the disk was
    2 USCG, especially with the confusion over other marks around the
    lighthouse, so I won't mark this either "Found" or "Destroyed" at this time.
    Additionally, it is possible that the mark could still be used for certain
    surveys because a significant portion of the stem remains to be able to
    determine where it was.
