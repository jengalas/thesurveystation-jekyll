    I was unsuccessful at recovering this triangulation station disk. According
    to the coordinates, it is located beneath a mobile home along 146th Street,
    just a block from the lighthouse. The base of the mobile home is surrounded
    by a skirt and wooden deck, making access to the mark difficult if not
    impossible at this time.
