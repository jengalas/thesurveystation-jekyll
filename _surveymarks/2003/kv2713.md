    We took a little detour on our way back from Berks County cache hunts today
    to search for this disk. The coordinates put us right in the middle of a
    factory complex, and nothing in that area matched anything in the
    description. So we stopped at the beautiful old public library and sought
    the help of the friendly librarian. He and his assistant, a little boy
    wearing a Kool-Aid mustache, directed us to the borough swimming pool. We
    found the marker easily once we were in the right part of town. The
    coordinates given on the page are approximately a third of a mile off, so
    I've added the coordinates that I noted at the spot. The marker is in
    excellent condition. It was a bit too chilly today for a swim in the pool!
