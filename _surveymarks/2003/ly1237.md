    After finding nearby [LY1238](/surveymarks/ly1238/), we thought
    we'd give this one a try. I expected little because NGS had been unable to
    find this mark just 25 years after it was monumented, and now it's been
    almost 70 years. Because the old railroad station is gone, we used
    information given in LY1238's description and measured, using the rails, the
    appropriate distance to determine where the station once stood. From that
    point, we were able to locate the approximate spot to begin our search. We
    probed a wide area around this point, keeping in mind the distances from the
    station and tracks mentioned in the description. No evidence of the monument
    or mark was found.

    The railroad station referred to in the historical description no longer exists. It's former location is difficult to pinpoint since nothing at all seems to remain of the structure. Working back from the location of **LY1238**, which indicates the railroad station was 300 feet west of “PTS 22,” a wide swath of ground extending roughly 50 yards east from the suspected railroad station and encompassing a distance of 21 feet from the tracks was carefully probed without success. ~Rich in NEPA~
