    The tower (the northmost one of two in the immediate area) was found as
    described. The pair of towers is accessible from the parking area for a
    public beach. There is a fee to enter, unless you're just taking photos of
    the towers (and you give the guy at the booth a nice smile). There are no
    changes to report except that Delaware Route 14 is now Delaware Route 1. See
    _(link removed: reference is gone and no suitable replacement was found,
    3/2011)_ for historical information on the towers that line the shore.
