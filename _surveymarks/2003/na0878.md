    This mark still exists and was an easy find, but it's in very poor
    condition. Someone apparently tried to pry off the disk, and it snapped in
    half. At least the vandals didn't get their “prize”. The description is
    accurate except that there is no longer a maple tree within 4 feet of the
    mark.
