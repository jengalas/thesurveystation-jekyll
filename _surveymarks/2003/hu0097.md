    This benchmark disk was found as described in a concrete filled tile in the
    southwest corner of the intersection of Sussex Place and the southbound
    lanes of Route 1. The mark was located easily using the historic
    description, but note that the witness post no longer exists and that Route
    14 is now Delaware State Route 1. The mark is approximately three feet east
    of a utility pole numbered 62454 / 9 465. At the site, I recorded
    coordinates that are approximately 338 feet from the coordinates given on
    the datasheet. The disk is in good condition and the date and designation
    are clearly legible. It appears that this disk initially was incorrectly
    stamped with U 28 instead of U 27.
