    Earlier this week, I'd been on my way home from a walk at Lake Scranton when
    I happened to notice some yellow paint on a rock outcrop just off the
    highway. I checked my USGS sheets and maps to see if there might possibly be
    a benchmark disk in the general area, and I was pleased to see that there
    was a mark that appeared to match. On this ugly, rainy Christmas Eve morning
    I took the quick drive up Route 307 to check out the painted rock outcrop. I
    parked in an empty lot belonging to a garden apartment complex and walked
    for only a few hundred feet through the woods until I emerged on the rock
    outcrop-and the mark was at my feet.
