    This benchmark disk was found as described on the north end of the west
    abutment of the Assawoman Bay Bridge, approximately 0.5 miles west-northwest
    of the intersection of Philadelphia Avenue and U.S. Route 50 in downtown
    Ocean City. The mark was located easily using the historic description, and
    no changes are necessary. At the site, I recorded coordinates that are
    approximately 85 feet from the scaled coordinates given on the datasheet.
    The disk is in good condition and the date and designation are legible.
