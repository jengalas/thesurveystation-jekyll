    This one was a tough find with the railroad station gone. The posted
    coordinates were less than 100 feet from what I recorded at the site, but I
    was initially distracted by a set of steps leading from Route 55 up to
    Rohman Road. Once I realized that I needed to be up on Rohman Road itself,
    the situation started to make more sense. It became a matter of finding the
    correct set of stone steps, which I did a moment later. The mark is now on
    the second step from the bottom (I suspect that the road was resurfaced and
    the bottom step was paved over) in the steps just beyond Rohman's Historic
    Tavern, which was already quite busy at just 1:00 in the afternoon. The disk
    is in good condition, especially for being so old. This is another of the
    turn-of-the-century Albany marks (see also [NA1433](/surveymarks/na1433)).
