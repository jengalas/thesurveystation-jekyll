    This tidal benchmark disk was found on the chimney foundation at the west
    side of the Atlantic Hotel. It was located easily using the historic
    description. Somerset Street, though still labeled as such, is now a
    pedestrian plaza east of Baltimore Avenue. A large flower box rested on top
    of the mark, but I was able to move it a few inches in order to take a photo
    of the disk. At the station mark, my etrex receiver indicated 111 feet from
    the scaled datasheet coordinates. The disk is in fair condition with legible
    stamping.
