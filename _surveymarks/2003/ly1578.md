    This benchmark disk was found as described on the east headwall of the
    overpass over Route 690 in Moscow. The only change to report is that the
    track is not one foot below the mark but is nearly level with it. The disk
    appears to be in good condition; though it is scratched, the stamping
    remains clearly legible.
