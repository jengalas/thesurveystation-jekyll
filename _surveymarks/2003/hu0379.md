    I haven't yet determined how to log this mark. At the southeast corner of
    the fence around the lighthouse—now a white iron fence, not a woven steel
    fence as described—I found a Coast Guard disk stamped “No. 1” set in a
    concrete post. However, the post projects much more than the five inches
    mentioned in the description; it projects at least twice that, and possibly
    more (I did not measure it at the time). To confuse the situation further,
    there is a Coast Guard mark with a separate PID of HU1478 somewhere at the
    lighthouse site. This mark is stamped identically to HU0379, but is set in a
    post projecting two feet. From the description it cannot be determined which
    fence corner this mark stood adjacent to.
