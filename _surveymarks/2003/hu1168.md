    This survey disk was found as described in the base of a street light just
    south of Eagle Drive. The mark was located easily using the historic
    description. The mark lies just northeast of the northeast corner of the
    parking lot for “The Carvinelle” apartments. At the site, I recorded
    coordinates that are approximately 172 feet from the coordinates given on
    the datasheet. The disk is in very good condition with all stamping clearly
    legible.
