    While Aaron sat at a convenient picnic table and munched on half of a
    cinnamon granola bar, I searched for these marks. We'd accidentally left the
    benchmark page printout in the car, so I didn't have high hopes of finding
    anything (other than [LY2561](/surveymarks/ly2561/)). But on our
    way to the tower I spotted RM 1 on a boulder and was inspired to search for
    the others. They were both straightforward to locate, and all markers are in
    good condition as noted by Rich.

    This triangulation station is in the immediate vicinity of the “Bearfort Fire Tower” located in the Pequannock River watershed . The historic descriptions lead to the correct locations for all three marks. At the station mark my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 9.2 feet from the NGS datasheet coordinates. The discs are in very good condition and well exposed, and the stamped designations are legible. There is no azimuth mark for this station. ~Rich in NEPA~
