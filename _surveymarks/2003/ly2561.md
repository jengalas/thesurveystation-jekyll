    Like Rich, we came upon this tower as part of our hunt for the “Bearfort
    Fire Tower” cache. The description and coordinates are more than adequate to
    locate the tower. I bet there's a great view from the top, but it was too
    windy and cold today to check it out for myself!

    The “Bearfort Fire Tower” Geocache is the namesake of this well-known
    landmark. During my hunt for the cache I took advantage of the opportunity
    to record this station along with another nearby set of survey marks. The
    historic description leads to the correct location, and there is no disc or
    marker other than the lookout tower itself. At the approximate center of the
    tower's base my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 11 feet from the NGS
    datasheet coordinates. ~Rich in NEPA~
