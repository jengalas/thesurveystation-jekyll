    This benchmark disk was found as described in the 1990 recovery note.
    Utility pole BJ 10 and the brick house are still in place, though the plank
    fence mentioned in the 1962 description no longer exists. The witness post
    was not recovered. The disk appears to be in good condition and the
    designation and date are clearly legible.
