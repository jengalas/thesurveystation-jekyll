    This Maryland State Highway Administration survey disk was found easily
    using the historic description; no changes are necessary. At the site my
    Garmin eTrex receiver recorded coordinates that were 48.7 feet from the
    scaled coordinates listed on the datasheet. The disk is in good condition
    with legible stamping. A firefighter took an interest in what I was
    searching for and allowed me to poke around inside the firehouse as well.
