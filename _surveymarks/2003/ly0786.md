    Following our encounter with New Jersey's loudest madman (at [LY0800](/surveymarks/ly0800/)), we thought a search for a mark in a
    more isolated area was in order. This mark, located just WNW of the
    intersection of Sussex County Road 560 and Upper Ridge Road, became our
    goal. The mark was simple to locate based on the historic description,
    although several details have now changed. Because the fences no longer
    exist, we recorded a measurement from the nearest powerpole to the station
    mark. The disk is in good condition and the date and designation are
    legible.

    **Recovered in good condition.**
    
    
    This second order vertical control station is set in top center of an outcropping boulder nearly flush with the ground in a brush-covered depression roughly 25 yards west-northwest of the intersection of county road #560 (the blacktop road) and Upper Ridge Road (the gravel road, now paved). The historical description leads reliably to the station. The northwest-southeast fence and the northwest right-of-way fence no longer exist. The station is 40 feet west of U.T. Co. of N.J. powerpole number 118. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record autonomous (non-corrected) coordinates which were 311.5 feet from the scaled coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet. The station mark is in good condition, and the stamped designation is clearly legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
