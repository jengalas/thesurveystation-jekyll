    This survey disk was located on a morning walk around town with friends from
    Secaucus. Although it was buried beneath almost an inch of soil and mulch, the
    mark was an easy find: an arrow and the designation are painted on the
    sidewalk nearby, and the description given on the datasheet is still
    accurate. The disk is in good condition and the stamping is legible.
