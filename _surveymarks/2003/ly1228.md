    I concur with all of Rich's observations. This is in fact the second time
    I've searched this area; this time I felt more confident that we'd find the
    mark since we had more time and resources to devote to the task. I'd like to
    search at least one more time before giving up on this benchmark.

    This vertical control station is described as being located on the top
    surface of a large outcropping boulder along the east side of Rt. 402. The
    historical description leads to what is now a large open parking area at the
    south end of Lake Shore Drive. A number of likely boulders were inspected
    within the wooded area just south of this space, but no mark was found.
    Measurements taken from the centerlines of Rt. 402 and Lake Shore Drive seem
    to indicate the boulder could have been within the bounds of this clearing,
    and may have been removed or pushed off to the edge when the parking area
    was created. This is pure speculation, and I intend to return and attempt a
    better search in the near future. ~Rich in NEPA~
