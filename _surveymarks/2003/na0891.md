    Aaron spotted this one from the car as we drove by; I had him pull into the
    parking lot of the Otesaga Hotel across the street so I could photograph the
    mark. We reached the area easily via the description (the streets are still
    the same) but the landmarks in the area have changed quite a bit. The
    concrete post was an easy find, however, standing right at the end of the
    fence. The disk was in excellent condition with the stamping clear, though
    the post was leaning slightly to one side.
