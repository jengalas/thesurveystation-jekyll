    The historic description leads right to this mark; it seems very little has
    changed in this area. Even the driving range is still in operation. The disk
    is easy to spot when driving on Route 307, and for once I didn't have too
    much trouble finding a place to park. The disk is in good condition with all
    stamping legible.
