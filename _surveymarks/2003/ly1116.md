    On our way to pick up a moving geocache in the nearby Tobyhanna State Park,
    Rich and I drove past the railroad station and control tower and he
    mentioned that he thought a benchmark was located nearby. Although it was a
    horribly cold and windy day and we could barely stand to be outside, on our
    way back home we did stop to search for the mark. We found it beneath some
    gravel at the base of the control tower as described, just east of Route
    1. The stamping is eroded and very difficult to make out, but the mark
    doesn't appear to have been disturbed.

    This second order vertical control station is set in the northeast corner of a concrete slab flush with the ground and adjacent to an abandoned two-story concrete railroad control tower. The 1956 historical description leads reliably to the station. The mark was covered with dirt and gravel. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record autonomous (non-corrected) coordinates which were 40.2 feet from the scaled coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet. The station mark is in fair condition, and the stamped designation is barely legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
