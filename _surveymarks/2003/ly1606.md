    This benchmark disk was easy to locate using the description. The details
    were accurate, even after 35 years. I felt a bit conspicuous when
    photographing this marker as it's located quite close to two homes, but at
    least I didn't have to take much time to search. The witness sign made it
    obvious where to look. The concrete monument isn't in great shape and is
    becoming overgrown, but the marker itself is in good condition.
