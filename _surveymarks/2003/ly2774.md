    Our main goal for the day was to locate and document CLIFF ET, but we had
    some time remaining and decided to look for EVANS ET as well. The 1968
    description led us easily to the station and reference marks, which were all
    in good condition. At the site we were also able to photograph the [microwave
    tower](http://www.americantower.com/OASISPublic/SitePublicPage/SiteBrochure.asp?lngSiteID=636&lngTowerid=-1) that serves as the azimuth mark for CLIFF ET.

    This second order triangulation station is situated on a wooded hillside that is just northwest of the rear of an American Tower microwave facility at Brier Mountain. From Tunkhannock at the intersection of Rt. 6 take Rt. 29 south for roughly 9.9 miles to the village of Bowman Creek (N41° 26.134' W076° 01.091'), bear left onto Rt. 309 south for 0.85 miles (N41° 25.510' W076° 00.662'), and turn left onto Dietz Mountain Road (T337) for 1.5 miles to a gated driveway left (N41° 26.411' W075° 59.730') leading to the microwave tower. Follow around the right side of the building through an open field, past the tower on the left, then bear left across a ditch at the start of the woods and uphill to the station. A handheld GPS receiver made locating the station an easy task.


    The historical description leads reliably to the station and the two reference marks. The station mark and both reference marks were found as described. None of the oak trees, the witness sign or any triangle blazes were found. The Harvey Fire Tower (Dallas Lookout Tower in the description) that was used for the azimuth could not be observed.


    At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with active remote antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were identical to the adjusted coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet. All marks are well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designations are legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
