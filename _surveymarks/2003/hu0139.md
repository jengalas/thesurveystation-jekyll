    This benchmark disk was found as described on the north wall of the school.
    It was located easily using the historic description, but note that the
    school is now the Lord Baltimore Elementary School. The posted coordinates
    are approximately 127 feet from the coordinates I recorded at the site. The
    disk is in very good condition and the date and designation are clearly
    legible.
