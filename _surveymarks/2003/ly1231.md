    This culvert was my final stop on a day of hunting benchmarks with Rich in
    NEPA. While certainly less interesting than nearby [LY2680](/surveymarks/ly2680/), this mark was a welcome easy find
    after that ordeal. We found two similar culverts in the area just south of
    Route 6 and west of Route 402; the mark is located on the one closer to the
    junction of Routes 6 and 402. The mark is in good condition, somewhat worn
    but with legible stamping. The description is accurate except that the Cedar
    Rest Drive Inn is no longer in operation.

    This vertical control station is located on the center top surface of a concrete culvert headwall along the south side of Rt. 6 and roughly 250 feet west of the intersection of Rt. 402. The historical description leads reliably to the station, the mark is well exposed and was easy to find. At the station mark a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 130 feet from the scaled NGS datasheet coordinates. The disk is in good condition and the stamped designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
