    FINALLY! After two attempts in the snow, and missing the chance to join Rich and Dave's hike last weekend, I finally made my acquaintance with George. On this sunny Sunday Aaron and I retraced my January route, and this time we found all the marks with ease. Of course, the GPS took us right to the station mark. Little did we know that we had our packs sitting right near the benchmark in March. 
    
    
    The historic descriptions were adequate to locate the two reference marks (though the witness post is long gone). All disks are in excellent condition. This is a peaceful spot with pretty views of neighboring mountains. (Nice meeting you, George!)

    This triangulation station can be reached most easily by following Ore Mine Road south and southwest from its trailhead near the concrete spillway at the south end of Lake Scranton for about 0.66 miles to just before a stone bridge crossing Meadow Brook, then bushwhacking up a moderately steep and rocky hill for about 0.63 miles through mostly open woods to a meadow on the summit of a low hill. (My route this afternoon, however, was a continuation along the jeep trail from LY2722 “COON”). The historic descriptions lead only roughly to the locations for all three marks since the witness post no longer exists. All three marks are well exposed and easy to see. At the station mark my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 0.0 (zero) feet from the NGS datasheet coordinates. The discs are in very good condition, and the stamped designations are legible. There is no azimuth mark for this station. ~Rich in NEPA~
