    I suspect this station is still viable, but it is on private property and I wasn't comfortable enough to attempt to search for it, nor did I see anyone nearby to ask for permission.
    
    
    I was able to find the azimuth mark, which is set into the curb along a public street north of the station. The azimuth is in good condition and is easily accessible.
