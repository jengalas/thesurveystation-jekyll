    This one didn't seem like it would be too much trouble, but we couldn't find anything resembling an old post office or any building that fit the given description. The new post office was built in 1965, and it is a block away from Market Street. This will take some more research!
    
    
    _**Update (18 March 2003)**_: A call to the Berwick Historical Society confirmed that the old post office, which was located on the corner of Market and Third Streets, was destroyed. It's likely the benchmark went with it.
