    The search for this rivet was much less exciting than the search for the other rivet nearby ([RV 2448](/surveymarks/ly0800/)). It was also less fruitful. Neither the rivet nor any of the reference objects could be found despite widening our initial search area by several hundred feet. 
    
    
    We believe there is a mistake on the datasheet concerning the marker type, which is listed as “bench mark disk.” The designation and description all refer to a rivet, so we assume that the marker is in fact a rivet, and not a disk.

    **Mark not found.**
    
    
    This second order vertical control station is described as being set in a concrete post near the intersection of a State highway and a blacktop road. The historical description says the mark is standard monel rivet, but the NGS datasheet lists the marker type as a standard benchmark disk. The to reach directions lead to the intersection of U.S. Rt. 206 (formerly State Highway S31) and Coursen Road (the blacktop road leading northeast), which is now an entrance to the Stokes State Forest Office. Neither the witness post, the right-of-way fence, nor a powerpole numbered “SD 200” were found in the area. There is a modern steel guardrail instead of a cable-style guardrail. A casual two-person search was conducted for the monument along the southwest side of the highway for about 100 feet in both directions from the suspected location but no evidence of the station was seen. ~Rich in NEPA~
