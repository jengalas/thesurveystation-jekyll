    Rich and I were unable to locate this mark. PennDOT's historic bridge survey
    database records this bridge as having been rehabilitated since the mark was
    placed. The text states: “The 36'-long T beam bridge built in 1932 is
    supported on reinforced concrete abutments with wingwalls. It is finished
    with safety shape concrete parapets from 1980, when the substructure was
    also rehabilitated.” (The database can be downloaded from the [PennDOT Cultural Resources
    Management Program Web Site](https://www.penndot.pa.gov/ProjectAndPrograms/Cultural%20Resources/Pages/default.aspx).)

    This second order vertical control station is described as being set in the top surface of the east wingwall of the south abutment of a highway bridge over Notch Brook. The historical description leads reliably to the site. However, the mark was not found. There is visible evidence that this structure was renovated since the station was monumented, the wingwalls having been capped with additional concrete. In the top of the southwest corner of the south end of the west concrete guard wall a chiseled square was found. ~Rich in NEPA~
