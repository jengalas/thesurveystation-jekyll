    This benchmark disk was found on a concrete step adjacent to the old
    Secaucus Public Library building. This building stands at the corner of
    Plaza Center Road and First Avenue, and it was shared with Engine Company #1
    until the library's 1999 relocation to a new building several blocks north
    on Paterson Plank Road. There is some confusion with the directions given in
    the description. The mark is not located at the northeast but rather near
    the west (or southwest) corner of the building. At the mark, we recorded
    coordinates that are approximately 57 feet from the scaled coordinates given
    on the datasheet. The disk was recovered in good condition with legible
    stamping.
