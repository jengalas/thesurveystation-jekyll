    There is confusion between this mark and HU0379. Like HU1478, HU0379 is also
    a Coast Guard disk stamped “No. 1”, set in a post projecting five inches.
    The post I found at the site projects much more than five inches, but less
    than two feet. There are also problems with this mark's description. The
    mark cannot be on the left side of the east-west road if it is also north of
    this road. If the fence mentioned in this description surrounded the
    lighthouse like the present fence does, the mark could not be at the
    southwest fence corner if it is reached before the lighthouse when traveling
    west. The situation might have been clearer if the monumented year had been
    stamped on the disk.
