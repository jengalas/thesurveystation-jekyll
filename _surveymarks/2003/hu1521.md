    This survey disk was found as described in the east end of the seawall at
    the southmost point of Ocean City. The mark was located easily using the
    historic description. The disk is worn almost smooth and most of the
    stamping has been obliterated. Only the triangulation disk symbol and the
    letters “LI” can be distinguished. The southeast corner of the seawall is
    eroding and may not provide a solid setting for the disk for much longer.
    The disk is in fair to poor condition.
