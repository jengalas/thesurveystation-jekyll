    I simply couldn't be this close to a benchmark (one with a degree of risk,
    no less) and not try for it. So after locating LY0621, I ran across the
    railroad bridge to search for this mark on the other side. It was a lot of
    fun, if you don't look down (this bridge was <i>much</i> higher over the
    river than I expected) and if you ignore the way the metal plates under your
    feet feel and sound loose. Just trust the bridge. There were plenty of
    people rafting on the river and fishing on the shore, but I didn't think any
    of them would turn me in for trespassing; I only wonder if these tracks are
    still used. Fortunately I had no run-ins with the law or with locomotives.
    Unfortunately, once at the northwest abutment I could see that the disk has
    been broken off from the stem, which survives (and has likely been used as a
    survey point; notice the orange paint). While near the mark, the rain,
    thunder and lightning began again, and so I made a quick dash back across to
    the New York side.
