    On a bitter cold, but pleasantly still and partly sunny day, Rich and I
    began our benchmark hunting in Promised Land with this mark. Even with a bit
    of snow on the ground, it was an easy find on a large boulder about 50 yards
    west of the parking area for the Rock Oak Trail in Promised Land State Park;
    the historic description leads directly to the mark and needs no updating.
    The disk is in good condition with both the date and designation
    legible.

    **Recovered in good condition.**
    
    
    This second order vertical control station is set in the top of an outcropping boulder roughly 50 yards west of a small parking area at the start of Rock Oak Trail. The historical description leads reliably to the station. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 41 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
