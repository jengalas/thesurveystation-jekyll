    This benchmark disk was found on the west corner of the northwest wall of
    the downtown Ocean City Post Office. It was located with ease using the
    historic description; no changes are necessary. At the mark, my eTrex
    receiver indicated 138 feet from the scaled datasheet coordinates. The disk
    is in excellent condition with all stamping legible.
