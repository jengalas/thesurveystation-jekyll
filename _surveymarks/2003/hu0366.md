    I went downtown to escape the floodwaters on this wildly stormy day ... but
    they followed me. This benchmark disk was located just southeast of the
    north corner of 109 Dorchester Street, which now houses the [Ocean City Beach Patrol
    Headquarters](https://oceancitymd.gov/oc/departments/emergency-services/beach-patrol/). The mark was reached easily using the historic
    description, and no changes are necessary. At the mark, I recorded
    coordinates that are approximately 270 feet from the scaled coordinates
    given on the datasheet. The disk is set vertically on the northeast wall of
    the structure and appears to be in good condition with all stamping legible.
