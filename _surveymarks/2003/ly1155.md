    This proved to be an exciting find! I love coming across manmade structures
    in the woods. We began our search too far north at a private road leading to
    some hunting cabins. We soon determined it was unlikely that a house had
    ever stood at this location, and we walked south on PA Route 402 for just
    over 100 yards until on our right we noticed a level area covered in young
    pine growth. Entering the woods at this point, we saw the steps immediately,
    and off to their right was a decrepit stone foundation filled—and
    surrounded—with old glass bottles, rusted cans, and other junk such as a
    child's rusted bed mattress. The mark was found on the steps exactly as
    described, and it appears to be in excellent condition with all stamping
    legible.

    This second order vertical control station is set in the center of the top surface of the second step of an old concrete stair platform along U.S. Rt. 402, roughly 120 yards south of a private woods road west. The historical description is still usable, but the apple tree no longer exists. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record autonomous (non-corrected) coordinates which were 380 feet from the scaled coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is clearly legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
