    It's hardly a "find"â€”you can't miss it. Still, William Penn's statue was a
    neat sight in the sunshine from a little park across the way. Though you
    certainly can't tell from this angle, the statue is over 36 feet tall, and
    it weighs almost 27 tons. Afterward we had to visit the nearby Reading
    Terminal market for some lunch.
