    There's no doubt I was in the right place—“O.C. 3” and an arrow were painted
    on the sidewalk adjacent to the bank lawn. However, the disk was not
    visible. Discreet probing was not enough to locate this mark, and I wasn't
    about to dig up the lawn in full view of the bank employees and patrons. I
    suspect the mark is still in place.  It might be easier to spot in winter
    when the grass is sparse.
