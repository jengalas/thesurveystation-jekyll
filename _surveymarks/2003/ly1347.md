    It's about time I got to this one! I've been looking at the cache page for
    months. I rode up with Rich on this beautiful sunny Sunday, and I found the
    mark easily. It's recognizable as a benchmark disk and the designation is
    legible if you look closely, but it's been painted over. The description is
    adequate to locate the mark.

    It was a cold and gloomy Sunday morning but I had the urge to do some cycling and at the same time search for a few local benchmarks. I rode out to Archbald and easily found this mark using the historic description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 513.6 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc appears to be in good condition, but the designation is not very legible, having been painted over. ~Rich in NEPA~
