    After a successful recovery (on our second try) of [LY1161](/surveymarks/ly1161), we hiked further along the Telephone
    Trail to this mark, the next in the series. The historic description brought
    us directly to the mark, which we found without difficulty on an outcropping
    boulder at the intersection of Telephone and Bruce Lake trails. The disk is
    in good condition with legible stamping. We took measurements from nearby
    reference objects for inclusion in our official recovery, and then we
    continued our hike eastward to the outer reaches of Promised Land State Park
    in order to recover the next mark in the series, [LY1159](/surveymarks/ly1159)â€”or at least that was the plan.

    This second order vertical control station is set in the top of an outcropping boulder at the intersection of Telephone and Bruce Lake trails within Promised Land State Park, at trail marker #76. The historical description leads reliably to the station. Station is 23 feet southwest of Telephone Trail, 17 feet northwest of Bruce Lake Trail, 40 feet southwest of the Bruce Lake sign on a tree near the trail intersection. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record autonomous (non-corrected) coordinates which were 352 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
