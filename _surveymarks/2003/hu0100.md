    While on an evening ride around town, we located this benchmark disk easily
    using the historic description. The spot was marked with both a stake
    wrapped in orange flagging tape and "ELEV. = 5.50'" painted on the highway
    shoulder. State Highway 14 is now State Highway 1, and the canal referred to
    is the Bethany Beach Loop Canal. The disk is in good condition with legible
    stamping.
