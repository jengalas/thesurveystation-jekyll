    Hard to believe Rich and I have passed this so many times without seeing it!  I suppose it's because we haven't gone up to the pavilion since we started looking for benchmarks.  This morning I decided to take a quick break from my jog around the lake and check out the view from the base of the old pavilion.  I was surprised to see this survey disk!
    
    
    At about 2 inches in diameter, this is a smaller disk than the typical USGS or NGS benchmarks. I have no idea what organization set this mark or where we could find data for it.
