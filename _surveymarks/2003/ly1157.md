    After our disappointing experience at a nearby bridge trying to locate
    another mark in this series, Rich and I took the 3/4 mile walk along Lake
    Laura Road to find this mark. This is a surprisingly pretty location, and
    even in November it was warm here in the sunshine. The mark is located on
    the third large boulder from the east at the intersection of the powerline
    cut and Lake Laura Road. It was found in good condition with legible
    stamping.

    This second order vertical control station is set in the top surface of a large boulder directly under a high-tension powerline running north-south and crossing Lake Laura Road. The historical description leads reliably to the station. There are four boulders centered in the clearing and the station is on the 3rd one (not necessarily the largest) from the east end. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 81.3 feet from the scaled coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, and the stamped designation is clearly legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
