    The Bethany Beach water tank was one of the first landmarks to greet me every summer when I came into town as a child, but I returned this year to notice that the tank is missing. Five years ago, the water tower was dismantled to make way for a new community center. The destruction of the tower is documented in the book _Bethany Beach Memoirs ... a long look back_ by James D. Meehan. NGS marked this station Destroyed in the database after I submitted this information.
