    This water tank was found as described in good condition; the directions are adequate.
    
    
    However, research has shown that the tank may be in danger of being destroyed. See Ocean City Meeting Minutes from September 24, 2002: #13: “Not on the agenda, City Solicitor Ayres addressed sales of personal property which are not codified, in the charter, or contained in the policy manual. Heretofore, sales have been done by ordinance. The dilemma has arisen with the proposed dismantling of the 66th Street water tower. Recommendation was to work with Assistant to the City Manager Kathy Mathias for placement in the Policy and Procedures Manual.”
    
    
    The latest news, from July 31, 2003, is that the “mayor threatens to veto any vote to remove old Ocean City water tank.” (Links removed because the pages they referenced no longer exist, 3/2011.)
