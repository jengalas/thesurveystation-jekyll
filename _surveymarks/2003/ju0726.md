    This is a tricky one. I'm not sure we were in the right spot, so I'll log
    this one as a note and try to come back when it's warmer and when I've done
    more research. There was a building numbered 1008-1010 Arch Street, but we
    saw no 1010-1012. We checked the entranceways, but both were completely
    covered in outdoor carpeting (and yes, it was glued down; I checked). Could
    this beautiful little disk lie beneath the carpet?
