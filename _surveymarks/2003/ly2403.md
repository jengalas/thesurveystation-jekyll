    On this bitter cold day, Aaron and I drove to Susquehanna thinking this
    would be an easy find. Hmmm, the bridge looks pretty new, we thought. But
    had it been built since 1982? The description didn't seem to match the
    situation before us, but we looked around anyway. I climbed the ice and snow
    covered hill alongside the bridge to get a good look at it from several
    angles, but found nothing. We gave up and took a very cold walk across the
    bridge; I have to admit that the ice flowing down the river did look pretty.
    On Monday I contacted the Susquehanna Branch library, and the librarian
    informed me that the bridge had been built within the past five years. So,
    it looks as though this benchmark might be gone for good.
