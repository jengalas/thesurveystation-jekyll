    I was really hoping to round out Death Hike day with a nice benchmark find
    with Ken "Mathketeer" Monks, but it wasn't to be. Although I believe I did
    find the location where this disk once was, and the stem it had been
    attached to, there is still the slightest doubt in my mind so I'm logging it
    as Not Found. We found a bolt-like metal object protruding from the top of
    what would be considered the southwest wingwall, since the railroad runs
    primarily north-south. It had obviously been damaged (and the wingwall has
    suffered a good deal of erosion as well), and there was no disk attached to
    it. At the site my GPS indicated just under 37 feet from the posted
    coordinates.
