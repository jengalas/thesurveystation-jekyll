    It was a little tricky to find the concrete bridge. At first we stayed on
    Route 209, missing the point at which that route and Broad Street diverge.
    After realizing we'd gone too far beyond the correct area, we turned around
    and I spotted the bridge through the trees. The marker itself was an easy
    find, thanks to the description and photos given by patw.
