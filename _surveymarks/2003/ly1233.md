    This sounded like an easy one, but we searched the area twice and were
    unable to find the mark. We followed the to-reach directions to the letter,
    ending up at a high-tension power line crossing. We took the indicated
    measurements from the road and from the power line right-of-way. No large
    boulder matching the description was found.

    **Mark not found.**
    
    
    The historical description leads to a steel high-tension transmission line but neither the mark nor the large boulder it's supposed to be set in could be located. Measurements were taken from Decker Hollow Road, and an extensive search was performed in the areas on both sides of the powerline and along the gravel maintenance road. No evidence of the mark or the setting were found. ~Rich in NEPA~
