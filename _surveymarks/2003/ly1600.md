    We were in the area and had time after locating LY1599 to search for one
    more benchmark. After locating the proper gravel road (Old Saw Mill Road, as
    Rich noted), it was a simple task to find the large boulder in the wooded
    area east of the gravel road. The disk is now cleared of dirt and moss and
    it is in very good condition.

    This vertical control station is located on the top surface of a very
    large boulder roughly 120 feet south-southeast from the intersection of Blue
    Shutters Road and Old Saw Mill Road, a dirt track leading south. It's easier
    to walk a few dozen yards along the dirt track and then turn directly into
    the woods to the left (east). The historical description leads reliably to
    the station, but the mark was concealed by a layer of moss. The surface of
    the rock around the mark was scraped clean as best as possible and the disk
    is now well exposed. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 44
    feet from the scaled NGS datasheet coordinates. The disk is in very good
    condition and the stamped designation is legible. ~Rich in NEPA~
