    I was really excited at the possibility of finding another of the 1898
    benchmarks, but unfortunately this one appears to be gone. There is no
    school building at the intersection of State and Maple Streets. Instead,
    there are the “Old Main” apartments. I haven't had much luck in locating
    anything about the history of the normal school!
