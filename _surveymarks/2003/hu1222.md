    This was the first of six successful recoveries on this beautiful Monday
    morning in Ocean View. The benchmark disk has been painted orange, which
    increased its visibility in the thick grass. Also aiding in the recovery
    were the letters "GPS" and an arrow drawn just south of the mark on the
    shoulder of Route 26. Both the white frame house and the gum tree are gone;
    the lot on the northeast corner of the intersection of Route 26 and Woodland
    Avenue is now empty. "7H" is no longer marked on the powerline pole nearest
    the benchmark, but the next pole north on Woodland Avenue is labeled "7I".
    The mark is in good condition and the stamped designation and date are
    legible.
