    Tonight I hurried over after work (and before dinner) to look for this
    benchmark. The description of its location on the bridge is accurate, though
    I don't recommend reaching this area by traveling on the Turnpike! I turned
    east onto Edella Road from Abington Road (Route 407), and followed Edella
    Road until I passed under the Turnpike. There's a convenient parking area on
    the southeast side of Edella Road, just after the Turnpike overpass and just
    south of the bridge. The posted coordinates were approximately 0.25 miles
    from the coordinates I recorded at the site. The disk is in very good
    condition with no stamping, as the description indicates.
