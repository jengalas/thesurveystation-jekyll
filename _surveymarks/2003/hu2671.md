    This horizontal control disk was found easily using the 1991 description; no
    changes are necessary except that the mark is now recessed slightly below
    the ground surface. The mark appears to be in excellent condition with
    legible stamping. The witness post is still in place next to the stop sign
    at the intersection of Hidden Acres Drive and Omar Road.  At the station my
    Garmin eTrex receiver indicated 16.8 feet from the datasheet coordinates.
    Note: this station is a Cooperative Base Network Control Station.
