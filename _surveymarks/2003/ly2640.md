    We took a quick trip up Route 209 for this one after locating a few
    benchmarks near the Pike County Courthouse. Only reference mark 3 was
    searched for and located at this time, since the station and other reference
    marks were below the surface of the ground, and we didn't know what to
    expect. RM 3 is at the Sunshine Station Early Childhood Center, on the step,
    just above and to the right of the bag of blacktop patch seen in the photo.
    The disk is in excellent condition and all markings are legible. We may
    return if we can find out more about the station and other reference marks.
