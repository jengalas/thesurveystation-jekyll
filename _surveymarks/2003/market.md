    This was the third benchmark we found today. The first was an NGS mark, [LY1434](/surveymarks/ly1434/), that we
    had been aware of when we came to this area for some geocaching this
    morning. The others, this mark and [22+96](/surveymarks/2296-2/), we found
    thanks to some helpful construction workers near LY1434.
