    Rich and I took a detour before one of our late-summer mountain biking trips
    to look for [KV3845](/surveymarks/kv3845/),
    triangulation station THORPE. The summit of Bear Mountain also has a fire
    lookout tower ([KV3846](/surveymarks/kv3846/)), which
    is still in use, and a modern communications tower.  Rich found this mark
    while climbing around on the enormous boulders in the area.
