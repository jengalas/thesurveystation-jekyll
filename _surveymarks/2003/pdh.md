    We were in the area of Ricketts Glen State Park for the [Red Rock
    and Rolls](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCD737_red-rock-and-rolls?ID=55095) event cache (geocachers' picnic), and had planned to arrive
    early in order to find a cache or two before meeting everybody else at the
    pavilion. Not far from the starting point for Mike(Bonanza)Burnside's
    intriguing [Downtown
    Ricketts](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCG241_downtown-ricketts?ID=67583) cache, I spotted the concrete bridge and thought "That would be
    a good spot for a benchmark." What do you know, there was one right there
    just a few feet from where I stood, beneath plenty of dirt and gravel, but
    obvious enough. I knew that [LZ0099](/surveymarks/lz0099/) was
    somewhere nearby, but as soon as I uncovered this mark I realized this
    wasn't it. Still, it was a cool bonus find! It's located on top of the
    southeast wingwall of a bridge on Route 487 over Mehoopany Creek, below the
    level of the road. The disk has no stamping, and I can't find a reference to
    it in any database. It's a Pennsylvania Department of Highways disk like
    many others that do appear in the NGS database.
