    Even though it was a dark, rainy night, I was determined to locate this
    benchmark while in Newark for dinner. Dad dropped me off in front of the
    Arts Center and drove around the block while I ran down the sidewalk in
    search of the mark. Even in near darkness I found it easily; the description
    was accurate and a bright pink and white triangle had been painted around
    the disk. It's in excellent condition with all stamping legible.
