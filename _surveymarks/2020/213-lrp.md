    Although Google Street View shows an old concrete bridge at this location,
    that imagery is from 2009; it has been replaced by a new bridge in the
    meantime. We searched all corners of the new bridge just in case the old
    benchmark was still present (or a new one had been set) but we found
    nothing.
