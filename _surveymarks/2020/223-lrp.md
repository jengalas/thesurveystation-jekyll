    223 LRP was the first benchmark Rich and I had on our list for today. It
    sounded promising: large boulder, the area didn't appear to have been
    disturbed. But when we arrived at the site, our hopes sank. The coordinates
    are located in a wooded area that is posted and overgrown, and we didn't see
    any large boulders. There were some smaller rocks that we could see from the
    road, but we would really have to go into the wooded area to see if we could
    spot anything more prominent. With two houses close by, we didn't feel
    comfortable poking around in there. We may try this again when the
    vegetation is down and if someone is at home who we can ask for permission
    to search.
