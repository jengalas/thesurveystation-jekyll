    This benchmark was our second attempt for the day, and it worked out about
    as well as the first one. We found the intersection easily, but there was no
    large boulder to be found. It might be overgrown but we found a large
    impression in the yard at the southeast corner of the intersection that
    looked suspiciously like a boulder might have been there at one point. This
    is another one that might be worth trying in the late fall or winter, or
    asking the homeowners when they are present.
