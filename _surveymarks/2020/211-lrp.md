    After our geocaching adventure and benchmark (re)recovery at the nearby
    State Game Lands, we drove a little further down Masthope Plank Road to look
    for two more benchmarks. Both were supposed to be set on old concrete
    culverts, and I never get my hopes up about those—usually, I've found, the
    culverts have been replaced and the disks are gone. But in this case, we
    were lucky! The old concrete culvert headwall was still in place. It was
    covered with a layer of moss that was apparently housing a large ant colony.
    Beneath it, I found the disk! The benchmark is in good condition. This part
    of the culvert headwall appears to be in good shape, too, although the rest
    of the culvert wall has shifted and may not be stable.
