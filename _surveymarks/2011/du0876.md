    We spent part of today exploring the Phoenix Zoo and Papago Park. Of course,
    one of the reasons we wanted to explore the park was to search for a few
    benchmarks! GUN sounded interesting and we were able to locate the station
    disk without any difficulty. It's a little beat-up, but the monument is
    still in good shape and easy to spot in the open desert landscape. RM 2 is
    embedded in a small rock; it is in good condition as well, and we had no
    trouble locating it using the coordinates and historical description.
    Unfortunately, RM 1 was a different story. We found a possible drill hole in
    a rock at the approximate distance and direction noted in the previous
    recovery, but it wasn't enough for us to say whether it truly had been the
    site of the reference mark. In any case, nothing is left and it is certainly
    not usable.
