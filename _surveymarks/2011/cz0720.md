    J 112 RESET was our final find of the day along the Encinas Trail in Saguaro
    National Park. We didn't hike the entire trail, but instead hiked in from
    the southeast corner to find the first two marks, and then drove around and
    hiked down from the northwest corner to find the remaining two marks along
    the trail. Like the others, this benchmark was in good condition, set into a
    round concrete monument near the base of a saguaro cactus. The wooden
    witness post still stands a few feet away from the monument.
