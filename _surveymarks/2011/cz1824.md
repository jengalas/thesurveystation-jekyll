    We hadn't planned ahead for this mark, but we happened to notice it on our map this morning as we considered where to hike in the eastern section of Saguaro National Park. It was close enough to Cactus Forest Drive that we could park and just wander around for a few minutesâ€”fortunately we found it easily! We suspected there were reference marks too, but without a datasheet, we were at a bit of a loss as to where to look. 


    Later in the evening, I checked the database and obtained the information about the reference marks. Three days later, we headed back to the area and, using the box score from the datasheet and some careful (somewhat precarious) searching among mounds of prickly pear cacti, we found all of the associated reference marks! All marks are in good condition.
