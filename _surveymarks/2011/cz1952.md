    VAH KI was our next find.  This was extremely easy to spot and in fact Rich
    spotted it from the road.  All three marks were in a line and just a few
    meters apart along a fence line. While we were taking our photos a man came
    zooming toward us on an ATV. Unlike what we might expect at home, though, he
    slowed down and waved pleasantly as he passed (also of note, he didn't
    harass us about what we were doing, just left us alone).
