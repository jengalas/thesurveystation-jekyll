    This afternoon's activities involved a search for several benchmarks near
    and along the Encinas Trail in Saguaro National Park. H 112 was the first
    one on our list, and it also just so happens to be a [virtual
    geocache](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC27BF_surveying-the-desert)! While we're not so enthused about searching for geocaches
    these days, we figured it would be a nice opportunity for a cache find in
    Arizona, along with several potential benchmark finds. It was a lengthy hike
    in the heat of the day, but we enjoyed walking along the trail (actually an
    old road) and eventually came upon the mark. It is in good condition and is
    set into a square concrete monument surrounded by a beautiful variety of
    cacti. As with many of these desert marks, the monument has some surface
    cracks but they don't appear that they will endanger the mark anytime soon.
