    T 94 was another find on our day of seeking out the marks along the Encinas
    Trail in Saguaro National Park. After hiking in from the southeast end of
    the trail and finding two benchmarks there, we hiked out, drove to the
    northwest end, and found this benchmark before hiking in along the trail for
    one more search. T 94 is in very good condition, set in a square concrete
    monument near the intersection of the trail and N. Sandario Road. Although
    witness posts seem to hang around a long time in the desert, in this case,
    the witness post mentioned in the 2001 recovery is no longer in place.
