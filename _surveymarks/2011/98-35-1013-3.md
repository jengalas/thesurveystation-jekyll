    Another neighborhood benchmark! I love the ones we can walk (or ride) to.  Note that although this is on the same bridge as the old PDH bench mark (shown on the topo map as BM 1219), it is not the same mark. The bridge was apparently rehabilitated or replaced, and that mark is gone. This is a newer PennDOT disk. It is in good condition, but the stamping isn't completely legible. My best guess is that the final digit is a 3.
