    Our afternoon began with a hike along one portion of the Encinas Trail,
    where we found several benchmarks. While driving around to hike the more
    northerly section of the trail, we stopped along Golden Gate Road (near the
    Ez-Kim-In-Zin Picnic Area) to look for E 295. This was an easy find, set in
    a prominent round concrete monument like most of the marks we've found here
    in the desert. It is in good condition as described, although the witness
    post wasn't found. The monument is surrounded by an assortment of cacti!
