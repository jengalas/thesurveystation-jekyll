    Today we were making our way toward Phoenix the “back way,” passing through
    Florence. After location two tri-stations, CACTUS and VAH KI, along Route
    79, we drove into the town of Florence and stopped at the old courthouse to
    look for the aptly-named mark FLORENCE. It's just about as obvious as can
    be, in a monument raised above the level of the sidewalk. The concrete
    monument has some small cracks running through it, but the disk is in good
    condition and seems to be solidly set into the monument.
