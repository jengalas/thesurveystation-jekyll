    This unstamped Arizona Highway Dept. disk was a bonus find during our
    recovery of the tri-station PINERY 2 nearby. Both marks are in the northeast
    corner of the intersection of Arizona Routes 181 and 186. This disk is in
    good condition, although it is set into a mound of chunky concrete that has
    seen better days. It is near the corner of a right-of-way fence and about
    two feet from a white-painted witness post labeled HWY. R. OF W. There is no
    stamping on the disk, other than the boilerplate agency marking and “19,” to
    which I assume was to be appended the year of establishment, during the last
    century.
