    Our first goal for this afternoon was to find H 112 along the Encinas Trail.
    D 295 was the next one along the trail, about a mile distant. It was hot,
    but we figured, what's one more mile? (Of course, it's really two when
    you're going out and back.) The trail is so pleasant and the desert is so
    beautiful to us that we enjoyed every step, and soon found ourselves looking
    at D 295. The monument and disk are in good condition. We could see the
    mound of concrete that had once supported the witness post, but the post is
    gone.
