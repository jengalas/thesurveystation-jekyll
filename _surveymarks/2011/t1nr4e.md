    While we were wandering around in Papago Park, we happened to spot this
    curious pile of stones from a distance. We investigated (of course) and
    found a section corner disk set on a pipe! It was our first cadastral survey
    mark (we don't have these in the eastern states) so it was exciting for that
    reason alone. And it's always fun to come across a mark that we weren't
    previously aware of. The pipe and disk seem to be in good condition, and
    it's very close to several trails and a loop road in the park.
