    Just like the nearby tri-station POST, this is a mark we weren't prepared
    for but happened to spot on our map.  This one was signified by a simple BM
    and an "x", plus the elevation, so we had no idea what type of mark it might
    be. We were fortunate that it was very easy to find in the location we had
    estimated from the map, and we were happy to see that it was something a
    little differentâ€”a U.S. Forest Service disk! We don't have a source for
    descriptions for Forest Service marks, so we aren't able to provide any
    official updates, but it was still a very neat find.
