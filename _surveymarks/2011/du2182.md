    This is one of the strangest landmark stations we've found! The tomb of
    Arizona's first Governor, George Hunt, is shaped like a pyramid and it
    stands on a hilltop in Papago Park, overlooking the park and the Phoenix
    Zoo. I don't know where the pyramid idea came from, but it's certainly an
    unexpected sight here in the Arizona desert. Too bad you can't go inside the
    fence to get a closer look, but the views from this little hilltop are
    fantastic.
