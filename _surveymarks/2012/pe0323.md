    Q 145 was the first mark we attempted to find on this warm, foggy morning.  Although the mark is supposedly over 70 feet north of the centerline of Route 102, we assumed that a 6'x5'x5' boulder would be easy to spot, even from the road.  We were wrong!  We could find no such boulder anywhere in the vicinity of the coordinates.  The datasheet reference to the northwest corner of a two story house doesn't make much sense either; it might if there were a house on the south side of Route 102, but there isn't one in this area, as far as we can tell.  We did walk west along Route 102 until we reached a house (on the north side of the road), but still, we saw no sign of a boulder of such large dimensions.  I would like to return and search again, perhaps concentrating our efforts around that house and even checking to see if MDOT has updated coordinates available in their online survey control point system.
