    After enjoying some artichoke pockets from Morning Glory Bakery for our
    breakfast, we took some time to document this mark, disk "D" in the 841 3320
    TIDAL series. It's located on a ledge adjacent to the Shore Path, and
    directly across the path from the Bar Harbor Inn. This is a beautiful spot
    for a benchmark with the hotels and trail on one side and the bay on the
    other! The disk is in very good condition.
