    There are several fairly new PennDOT survey marks placed in bridges along PA
    Route 438. They're a relatively short walk from home and we had some fun
    exploring and recovering them today. This disk is set into the northwest
    corner of the bridge headwall, and it is in good condition. The bridge is
    just southeast of Hopfer Road and crosses over Elm Brook.
