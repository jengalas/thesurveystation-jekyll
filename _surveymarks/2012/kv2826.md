    On my way to the 14th annual Death Hike, I took a slight detour from Route
    924 to Old Route 924 in order to search for this mark.  The fog was dense,
    but the bridge was easy enough to spot as I approached, and the standard PDH
    mark was similarly easy to see from a distance.  It is in good condition on
    the south wingwall of the southwest abutment of the bridge, as described.  I
    found a deer tick on one of the tall weeds in this location (prompting Dr.
    Monks to wonder whether ticks hang out near benchmarks with the knowledge
    that sooner or later, someone will arrive and provide a tasty meal)!
