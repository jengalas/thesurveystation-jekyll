    Our main activities for the day were to visit Seneca Lake and sample some of the local wines, but I couldn't resist hunting for a few survey marks while in a new area.  (Note: we found both marks _before_ we started sipping wine!)
    
    
    This bench mark disk is set vertically into the west-facing foundation wall of the Schuyler County Court House in Watkins Glen.  It can be seen from N. Franklin Street (Route 14).  We found a convenient parking spot right in front of the court house, and Rich, my father, and I checked out the mark.  It is in good condition with legible stamping.
