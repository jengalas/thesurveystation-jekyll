    There isn't much better (in December, anyway) than a sunny, 64° day.  We
    simply had to take advantage of our long morning by scouting out some
    probable benchmark locations near Clifford.  We hadn't even intended to get
    out of the car, but when I drove slowly past our plotted coordinates for TT
    28 T and spotted a prominent outcrop in the woods with a bright blue spot on
    its high point, we had to take a closer look.  The disk is set into an
    outcrop (approximately 3' x 5') in open woods just a few yards northeast of
    Hickory Ridge Road, and directly east of the T-intersection of Hickory Ridge
    Road and T-564 (Telep Rd.).  The benchmark disk is in excellent condition.
