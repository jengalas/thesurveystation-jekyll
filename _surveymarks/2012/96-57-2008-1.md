    There isn't much better (in December, anyway) than a sunny, 64Â° day. We
    simply had to take advantage of our long morning by scouting out some
    probable benchmark locations near Clifford. While on our way to look for the
    USGS bench mark disk TT, I checked the wingwalls of a bridge we crossed over
    and was pleased to find this old PDH disk. Like many of these disks, it has
    been stamped more recently with a designation, but we're unable to find any
    information about the mark. It is in good condition, although with so many
    of these older-style bridges in the area being replaced, it may not survive
    here for long.
