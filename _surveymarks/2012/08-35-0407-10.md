    We were driving home from my parents' house this evening and as we passed
    over this bridge near Waverly I thought I spotted a disk on the corner of
    the bridge. We stopped to check it out and were pleased to find another
    PennDOT disk. It's too bad we have no source for descriptions of these
    marks, or any way to report their condition.
