    Rich and I spent the day on a day-trip with my father, who has been wanting to visit and hike at Hawk Mountain for several months already. He's been working a lot, but he finally got an opportunity for a trip to Hawk Mountain, as well as some great weather to enjoy it. Along the way, we planned on checking out the Yuengling Brewery in Pottsville.


    Would any day-trip be complete without a search for a survey mark? I didn’t have much time to research other marks in the area, and it’s just as well because I knew we wouldn’t have time to do a serious hunt for a tri-station or anything else difficult. But there is a bench mark disk, POTTSVILLE, set into the base of the Civil War monument (Soldiers’ Monument of Schuylkill County). We found it easily, took a few photos, and then hiked up the hill toward the brewery. 


    The disk is in very good condition. It is set as described into the southeast corner of the base of the monument.


    _The station was not reported to NGS at this time because its condition has not changed since the previous report of November 2011._
