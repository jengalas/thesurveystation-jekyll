    Expecting nothing after our strikeout at nearby Q 145, this search was a pleasant surprise. Rich and I saw the huge boulder from the road—basically, the very same type of boulder we had expected to find for Q 145—and had no trouble uncovering the disk. The mark is in good condition and should be easy to locate and use.  
    
    
    One small update to the description is that the dirt road referred to is now paved and is called Northern Neck Road. In our research we were unable to find any historical references to Glenmerry Lodge, although there is a Glen Mary Road in Bar Harbor. I have no evidence that the two are connected in any way.
