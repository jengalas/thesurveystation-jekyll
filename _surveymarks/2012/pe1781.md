    Rich and I had a restful morning. After Dad left for home, we spent some time at our “secret” spot, just relaxing in the sunshine.  Then we took a ride to Otter Point to see if we could find anything left of the old OTTER station, a tower at the highest point.  We parked in the lot and made our way through several yards of open woods and scrub to reach the coordinates.  Obviously there's no longer a tower (the NGS datasheet indicates that the tower was moved to Schoodic Point in 1946) but we did find a drill hole at the coordinates and some anchor bolts spread around, and some concrete that was likely part of a foundation. 
    
    
    There is some confusion over what exactly was at this site. The only tower we have found in our research that was built at this high point was an octagonal tower (as seen here: “[Looking for the Lookout](https://fromthecreek.com/?p=1395),” <cite>From the Creek</cite>, by Karen Zimmermann), not the WOODEN HOUSE SUPPORTED ON FOUR WOODEN LEGS described on the NGS datasheet. So I'm not sure what happened here, but as far as I know the tower pictured was the only tower on this site. In any case, it's completely gone now. Bolts and eyebolts that served as supports remain.
