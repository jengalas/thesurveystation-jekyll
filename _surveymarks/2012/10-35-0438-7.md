    There are several fairly new PennDOT survey marks placed in bridges along PA
    Route 438 (Montdale Road). They're a relatively short walk from home and we
    had some fun exploring and recovering them today. This disk is set into the
    southeast corner of the bridge headwall, and it is in good condition. The
    bridge crosses over the South Branch of Tunkhannock Creek.
