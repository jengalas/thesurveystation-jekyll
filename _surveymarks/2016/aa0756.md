    Finding benchmarks along these bridges in the Keys is like shooting fish in
    a barrel. They're everywhere! This one is on the southwestern corner of the
    highway bridge over Park Channel, just a few yards from [C 272 (AA0140)](/surveymarks/aa0140/).
    This tidal benchmark is in good condition.
