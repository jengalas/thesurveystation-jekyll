    Recovered in good condition on the north wingwall at the west end of the old
    seven mile bridge. This section of the former bridge is now a fishing pier
    and part of a recreational trail. The current Seven Mile Bridge is directly
    south of the old bridge.

    B 70 RESET was part of the “benchmark bonanza” we stumbled upon at the
    western end of the old Seven Mile Bridge. There are four marks at this end
    of the bridge, two within less than a foot of each other (DUCK 2 and B 70
    RESET). The mark is set at the extreme top of the northern wingwall of the
    old bridge, the western end of which is now used as a fishing pier. The
    benchmark is in good condition.
