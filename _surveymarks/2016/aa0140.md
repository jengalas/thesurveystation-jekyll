    There are so many old bridges in this area that used to be part of the
    highway, and were kept in place for use as fishing piers (and as part of the
    Overseas Heritage Trail) when the new highway was built. We passed over
    several of these bridges this morning on our way to Bahia Honda State Park.
    As we've come to expect, there were many benchmarks to be found on the old
    bridges. C 272 is still in place on the northwest curb of the old bridge,
    but it has been damaged. The bottom one-quarter of the disk has been scraped
    or sheared off.  The designation and date are still legible. It's difficult
    for us to tell whether the mark is stable enough to be usable; our guess is
    that it is fine for an elevation.
