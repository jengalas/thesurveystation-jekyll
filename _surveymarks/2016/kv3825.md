    This unusual disk was established by the Reading Bureau of Water. There is apparently an associated disk just north of this one, but I wasn't aware of it while we were here. If we're in Reading for the air show next year, we'll take a look. This mark is also used as RM 2 for triangulation station [READING](/surveymarks/kv2200/), at the south entrance of the park. I'm listing it separately here because it has its own designation and PID.
    
    
    This disk is in very good condition and is easy to locate, just south of the park entrance. It's even plainly visible on Google Street View. My favorite part of this find was the wording on the disk. Instead of the standard “$250 fine for disturbing this mark,” this disk is stamped ”Arrest will follow disturbance of this mark.”
