    Rich and I spent a fantastic morning in Montrose finishing up the third
    annual Architectural Treasure Hunt. After turning in our clue sheets,
    stopping for some chocolates and having lunch, we drove back home by way of
    Route 29. Along the way, it occurred to me that there was a new geocache
    near Lake Carey, so we took a short detour to search for it.  We didn't find
    the cache, but we did find this old PDH disk on the bridge nearby. It's
    stamped with a new PennDOT number. It appears to be in good condition and
    quite stable.
