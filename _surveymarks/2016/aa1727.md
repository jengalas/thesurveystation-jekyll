    Recovered in good condition. The disk is stamped with the designation 3872 G
    and the date 1987. It is located on the southwest wingwall at the western
    end of the old bridge over Channel Five, which is now a fishing pier. The
    current U.S. Route 1 bridge is directly south of the old bridge.

    One of this afternoon's activities was a hike at Long Key State Park's Layton Trail, a short but eerily beautiful walk north to the bay from Route 1. We entertained the idea of hiking the Golden Orb Trail in the other part of the state park, but decided that we wanted to spend more time there than we had left in our afternoon. So instead, we took a leisurely drive back up Route 1 and stopped at two fishing piers along the way in search of benchmarks. These fishing piers are sections of the original Route 1 that have been repurposed for fishing and as part of the Florida Overseas Highway Trail.
    
    
    The first one we found was 872 3872 G TIDAL. It is located in the southwest wingwall at the western end of the old highway bridge over Channel 5. It is in good condition.
