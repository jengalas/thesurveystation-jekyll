    One more mark in the DSW series was planned for today. Rich and I made a
    loop around Lake Spangenberg and through Maplewood on the way to our
    traditional 4th of July picnic. The bridge that 39 DSW is set into hasn't
    been replaced, as have most of the other small bridges in this area. The
    mark is set in a wingwall of the bridge, but I'm not sure I would describe
    it as the north wingwall; it's more like the southeast wingwall. It is
    northeast of the centerline of the road over the bridge.  The mark is in
    good condition and the wingwall and abutments seem solid, but the bridge
    deck appears to be crumbling and if it is eventually replaced, the mark may
    be in danger.
