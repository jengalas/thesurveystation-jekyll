    Rich and I spent the late morning and early afternoon poking around the
    White Mills area. After a stop at the Cactus Man, we drove just a short
    distance further along Route 6 and then turned onto White Mills Road. Before
    leaving the house this morning, we just happened to check the topo map and
    noticed that it indicated a bench mark at the southwest corner of the bridge
    over the Lackawaxen. It should have been an easy find, but the bridge has
    apparently been repaired, modified or replaced since 1965. There was no USGS
    bench mark on any part of the abutment. We did, however, find a relatively
    new PennDOT disk set into the southeast corner of the bridge (as a further
    suggestion that the bridge has recently been altered in some way).
