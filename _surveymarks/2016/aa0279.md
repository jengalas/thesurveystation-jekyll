    Recovered in good condition on the south wingwall at the west end of the old
    Seven Mile Bridge. The current Seven Mile Bridge is directly south of the
    old bridge. The wingwall is located between the old and new bridges and is
    still accessible.

    This tidal disk was our fourth find at the west end of the old Seven Mile
    Bridge. Talk about a benchmark bonanza! Like the others, this disk is in
    good condition. It's easily accessible; simply walk east along the grassy
    patch between the two bridges toward the wingwall.
