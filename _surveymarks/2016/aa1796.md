    While on our morning stroll around Key West, we checked the pier for two
    marks that we had little hope of finding. After checking the northern side
    of this pier for IVY 1935, we checked the southwestern corner in hopes of
    spotting something relating to PIER A. The promenade is covered in
    relatively new concrete and bricks and it seems likely that the mark was
    simply covered at that time. We used both the adjusted coordinates and the
    measurements from reference objects in the description. As expected, both
    brought us to the same spot but neither offered enlightenment. In our
    opinion, the mark is probably still in place but not easily accessible or
    usable at this time. (There is a temporary mark, a nail with a washer, near
    the coordinates, but this appears to have no connection to PIER A.)
