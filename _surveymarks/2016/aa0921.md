    After a fun lunch at the Sunset Grille at the eastern end of the Seven Mile
    Bridges, we decided to work off our oysters and Guinness with a walk along
    the old bridge toward Pigeon Key. As we climbed up to the bridge I decided
    to check the new highway bridge wingwalls and curbs to see if we were
    missing anything. No real surpriseâ€”there was yet another tidal benchmark
    disk set in the concrete base for the guard rail! The disk is in good
    condition and is surrounded by a circle of faded blue paint.
