    We had some time at Flamingo before our tour of the bay, so we investigated
    the seawall around the marina for benchmarks. We knew they were plentiful in
    this area because we found quite a few of them when we were here two years
    ago; but, believe it or not, I was feeling burned out on benchmarks at the
    time, so we only documented a few of them. Today we wandered around and
    recovered most of the remaining marks. This one is set into the inner south
    corner of the seawall that forms the north border of the marina shop parking
    area. Like the other disks along the seawall, it's a small USDI/NPS disk
    stamped with the mean low water elevation. It is in good condition.
