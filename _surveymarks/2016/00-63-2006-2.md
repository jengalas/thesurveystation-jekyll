    We went looking for  220 LRP, a USGS disk that we expected to find on the
    northwest abutment of this bridge over the Lackawaxen. We didn't find that
    markâ€”either the abutment has been repaired or rebuilt, or the bridge has
    been replaced. But we did find this PennDOT disk set into the opposite
    wingwall. From the stamping, we assume it was set in 2000. It is in good
    condition.
