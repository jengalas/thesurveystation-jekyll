    MON 4 was the first mark Rich and I attempted on this chilly (for Florida)
    Saturday morning. We didn't expect it to be much of a challenge because the
    description is quite straightforward. When we were investigating the area
    from our desks at home, we thought we could even see a number of likely rock
    outcrops in Google Street View. But as sometimes happens, once we were on
    the site, our perspective changed. There are indeed some exposed rock
    outcrops, but we didn't see the mark on any of them. A significant portion
    of each outcrop was covered with grass and sandy soil. The road shoulders in
    the area do not appear to be disturbed in any way, so it's very likely the
    mark is still in place and is simply overgrown at this time. We noted one
    change to the official description: the power pole should be numbered
    SL-9-162 . Even though we didn't find the mark, the pole with this number is
    in the correct location according to the other given points of reference,
    and it is also consistent with the numbering of the other poles on the line.
