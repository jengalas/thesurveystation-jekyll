    The station and RM 1 were recovered in good condition on the north wingwall
    at the west end of the old seven mile bridge. This section of the former
    bridge is now a fishing pier and part of a recreational trail. The current
    Seven Mile Bridge is directly south of the old bridge.

    Rich and I found DUCK 2 in the same way we made most of our survey mark
    finds on this trip: just by pulling off the road at each end of the bridges
    and taking a look. As a side-of-the-road tri-station with only one reference
    mark it may not appear to be too exciting, but it was really quite bizarre
    in that another disk (benchmark B 70 RESET) is set into the wingwall less
    than a foot from DUCK 2! And there are two other marks on this same
    abutment. Our current hypothesis is that NGS surveyors convinced their
    bosses that they really, really needed to set lots of marks in the Keys. And
    the work had to be done in January. :)
