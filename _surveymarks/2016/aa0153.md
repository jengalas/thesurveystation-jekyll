    Recovered in good condition. The mark is located in the southwest wingwall
    of the old bridge over Bow Channel. The old bridge is now used as a fishing
    pier and part of the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail.  The mark is
    adjacent to the Sugarloaf Key/Key West KOA Campground and marina.

    We really hit the benchmark bonanza at the site of the bridges over Bow
    Channel. This was the sixth mark we found here today. This NGS bench mark is
    set into the bottom of the southwest wingwall of the old bridge (now a
    fishing pier). We walked down a short gravel trail to the KOA marina, where
    we found the mark set into the wingwall. The marina was hopping with
    activity on this beautiful February day, but no one seemed very interested
    in what we were doing. The disk is in reasonably good condition, with some
    superficial scratches on the surface.
