    Recovered in good condition. The mark is located on the north curb at the
    western end of the old bridge over Channel Five, which is now a fishing
    pier. The current U.S. Route 1 bridge is directly south of the old bridge.

    While on our Long Key benchmark bonanza, Rich and I made a fortuitous stop
    at the fishing pier at the western end of the bridge over Channel 5,
    northeast of Long Key. Among several disks we found at this location was 872
    3872 D TIDAL. It's set into the north curb of the old Route 1 bridge (now a
    fishing pier at this location) at the western end of the bridge. It is in
    good condition.
