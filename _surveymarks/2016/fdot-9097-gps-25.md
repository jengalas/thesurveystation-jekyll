    We don't have much information about this FDOT disk; it doesn't appear to have been entered into the NGS database, and FDOT control is not available online. We found it in a grassy area at the eastern end of the Long Key Viaduct, where in fact we were searching casually for an NGS triangulation station, [HIGH](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=AA1413). (We found no evidence of that mark or its reference marks, but it should have been very close to the location of this FDOT mark.)
    
    
    This disk and its monument are in good condition. The stamping is light but still legible. It's set within a couple yards of a sign “Long Key” and very close to a cable TV access hatch.
