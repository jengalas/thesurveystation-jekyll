    Interestingly enough, there are two marks stamped M.L.W. 8.31 just a few
    feet apart, on the section of seawall southeast of Flamingo Visitors Center.
    If you look closely, you'll see that one of them has a “1” stamped on the
    right-hand side of the disk. That is this mark, NGS PID AB2411. The other
    one, without the “1”, is AB2412. They are both in good condition and, just
    like the other marks on the corners of the seawall all around Flamingo and
    the marina, very easy to find. (Just don't mix up the PIDs!)
