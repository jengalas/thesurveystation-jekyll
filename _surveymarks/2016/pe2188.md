    This one may be a bit of a stretch, but I'm including it anyway just for
    fun. We observed the beacon from the 446' high observation tower that is
    part of the new Penobscot Narrows bridge. So cool that we could see the
    beacon clearly from over three miles away (even if it didn't photograph all
    that well)!
