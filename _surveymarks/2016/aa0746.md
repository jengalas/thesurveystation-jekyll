    While on our way to check out the abandoned section of Old State Route 4A,
    which is a little-known part of the Key Deer Refuge, we stopped at the
    bridge over Sugarloaf Creek to check for benchmarks. We found F TIDAL at the
    eastern end of the bridge, set in the southern curb. The disk is in good
    condition and is stable, but the stamping is very difficult to read.
