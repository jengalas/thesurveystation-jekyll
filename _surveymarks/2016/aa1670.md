    This mark was in a tricky spot close to speeding traffic, but Rich very
    carefully and quickly took the photo for me.  This Florida DOT bench mark is
    in very good condition. It's set in the southwest corner of the highway
    bridge over Bow Channel. (That makes five marks at this siteâ€”shall we go for
    six?)
