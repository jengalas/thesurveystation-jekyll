    We had planned to spend the whole day in Key West, from breakfast through
    till sunset at Mallory Square. At some point during the afternoon we
    realized it would probably be chilly as the sun went down, so we walked back
    along Southard Street to the parking garage to pick up jackets for the
    evening. Along the way, we found this disk embedded in the sidewalk at the
    east corner of the intersection of Angela and Whitehead Streets. It's in
    good condition for a disk that probably gets stepped on thousands of times a
    day. We're not sure of the designation. Two years ago we found two other
    “PNC” disks, the designations of which both included numbers after the PNC.
    All three have numbers stamped near the top of the disks too (90/13/0.1 in
    this case); we don't know what they mean.
