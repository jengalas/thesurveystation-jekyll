    This year, like last, we chose Jacobsburg State Park as our morning hiking
    destination before the Banff Mountain Film Festival showing in Bethlehem.
    Last year's hike took us to the southern section of the park, past the old
    Henry homestead and other sites of the historic town of Jacobsburg. This
    year we chose the western “Sorbers Run” section of the park. On our way
    there from the park's visitors center, Dad, Rich and I came across this old
    PDH disk. The disk is unstamped and undated and is in good condition. It is
    set into the northwest corner of the sidewall of a bridge carrying
    Jacobsburg Road over Bushkill Creek.
