    While on our morning stroll around Key West, we checked the pier for two
    marks that we had little hope of finding. The first was IVY. About five
    years ago a geocacher wrote that there appeared to be newer concrete and
    bricks in the area. Combined with the latest recovery notes on the NGS
    datasheet, we were pretty sure the mark is no longer accessible, but we've
    found supposedly "missing" marks before, so it was still worth a try.  Even
    a depression in the concrete or a nail on a nearby structure could prove
    interesting. This time, however, we found nothing. There is indeed newer
    concrete in the area, which is now a promenade deck in front of the Westin
    Resort and Marina. The mark may still be in place beneath the concrete, but
    it's not feasible to access or use it at this time.
