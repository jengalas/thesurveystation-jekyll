    Yes, it's another benchmark on the bridge over Bow Channel! Just like the
    others nearby, 872 4332 H TIDAL is in good condition. The disk is partially
    covered by the remnants of white paint, but the stamping is all legible. (By
    this point, Rich was saying “how many more can there be?!”)
