    To round out our Long Key benchmark blitz, we stopped at the western end of
    the Long Key Viaduct to see what we might find. And as is almost expected in
    the Keys, we found several marks. The first was 872 3706 F TIDAL, which
    scared me a bit as it is located on the railing of the new highway bridge
    (think dozens of crazy Florida drivers flying by!) and Rich climbed up and
    over to get a photo of the disk. He was able to take the photo quickly and
    return to the safety (with the exception of a few fire ants) of the area
    between the old and new bridges. The disk is in good condition with legible
    stamping (3906) that differs from the mark's designation in the database
    (3706). It seems that the discrepancy is known because the difference
    between the designation and stamping is noted on the datasheet. However I'm
    pretty sure that NGS's policy is not to change the given designation even
    when it appears to be a typo; they simply note the true stamping in the
    proper field.
