    After a fun lunch at the Sunset Grille at the eastern end of the Seven Mile
    Bridges, we decided to work off our oysters and Guinness with a walk along
    the old bridge toward Pigeon Key. Despite horribly strong winds and the fact
    that I had to pee almost the entire way, we made it to Pigeon Key and back,
    and enjoyed every step. And along the way, we spotted this little disk that
    we had somehow missed before! It's a geodetic control disk set by a local
    firm whose recoveries we've seen for other marks in the NGS database (such
    as BUNCH). The disk is set along the southern edge of the bridge (in the
    deck, not the curb) about two-thirds of the way from Knights Key to Pigeon
    Key.
