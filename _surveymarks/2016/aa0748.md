    While on our way to check out the abandoned section of Old State Route 4A,
    which is a little-known part of the Key Deer Refuge, we stopped at the
    bridge over Sugarloaf Creek to check for benchmarks. G TIDAL is set in the
    western end of the bridge, set in the northern curb. The disk is in very
    good condition with legible stamping.
