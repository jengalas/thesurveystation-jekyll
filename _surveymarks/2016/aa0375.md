    Recovered in good condition. The mark is located on the north wingwall at
    the western end of the old Long Key Viaduct, which is now a fishing pier and
    part of the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail. The current U.S. Route 1
    bridge is directly north of the old bridge. The mark can be accessed by
    parking in the lot for the fishing pier and walking to the section of the
    old wingwall between the two bridges.

    The final find of our Long Key-area benchmark blowout was Q 69 RESET. It is
    located on the northern wingwall at the western end of the old Long Key
    Viaduct (now a fishing pier). The current U.S. Route 1 bridge is directly
    north of the old bridge; this mark can be accessed by parking in the lot for
    the fishing pier and walking to the section of the old wingwall between the
    two bridges. The disk is in good condition.
