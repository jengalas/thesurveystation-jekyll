    Given my obvious interest in airway beacons, it was a pleasant surprise to
    find that the site of an old beacon was very close to today's lunch spot,
    the Point Phillips Hotel. After filling up there, Rich and I took a drive
    along Beacon Road to see what might be left of the beacon. Unfortunately,
    the tower is gone and we couldn't find any signs of the base either
    (although since this is still a busy working farm, we didn't get out of the
    car to look closely).
