    Our final find for today, that was coincidentally (...or not) on our way to the Waymart Hotel, was 41 M. Even though it was a side-of-the-road mark, which are typically not that exciting, this was a fun and challenging hunt. 


    By this point in the summer the roadsides are typically overgrown with weeds, and that's what I found along Dundaff Street near the coordinates for 41 M. I walked up and down the road but couldn't find a single boulder among the weeds or in the woods behind. Finally a breeze blew a small tree's branches aside and the sun hit at just the right angle, and I spotted the mottled gray surface of a boulder! I hopped over the ditch and lifted the tree branch to discover the disk set into the high point of the boulder. 


    I wasn't so lucky with the reference mark, which was supposed to be a chiseled square on a boulder on the other side of the road. There were a few boulders but they had obviously been placed there more recently than 1942, and they weren't in the correct location.
