    I don't quite know how we missed noticing this benchmark on the topo map, but somehow when I found the datasheet on PennDOT's site a few days ago, it was a new one to me. In addition to being a USGS mark, it's also in the NGS database, so it's doubly confusing why we never looked for it before. 
    
    
    Anyway, it seemed like it might be a simple find—and it still might be, once the vegetation is down in the late fall or winter. Rich pulled off the side of Route 6 and I climbed the steep bank. I found a few large boulders that would be suitable for a benchmark, but the mark wasn't on the only one that I could access. The others were covered with thick overgrowth. 
    
    
    We'll have to try again later. I never mind having another excuse to come to Waymart, because it might mean breakfast or lunch at the Mustard Seed or a snack at the Waymart Hotel ...
