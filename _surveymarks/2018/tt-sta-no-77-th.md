    Our second-to-last mark for the day eluded us, but only because of a wire
    fence that made it clear we were not to trespass in the pasture. This was
    such a cool spot! The corner of the pasture is dotted with many boulders and
    rock outcrops, most of which would be perfect for a bench mark. And the
    grass was low because livestock probably graze here. But without permission,
    we didn't feel comfortable crossing the fence. The land appears to belong to
    the farm to the southwest, along Route 2023. But no one was around to ask.
    We will definitely be coming back for this mark!
