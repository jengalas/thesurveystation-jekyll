    What a bizarre spot for a benchmarkâ€”in the middle of a stream?! I'm not sure
    if it's really a stream as described, but it's drainage of some kind. Two
    large culverts direct water through the area, one from the south and one
    leading to the west. I was able to make my way into that jungle-like area
    and walk around (not easily). Most of the rocks in the area were single,
    loose rocks rather than outcrops, but I saw a few outcrops here and there.
    However, they were bare and it would have been easy to spot a mark on them.
    The benchmark is probably still here, but either I didn't come across the
    correct outcrop or it was covered in moss or other vegetation. This would be
    worth another visit.
