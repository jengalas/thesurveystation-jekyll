    This mark was another one that we labeled as “probably still there, among the high grass”! The grass in the yard is high and messy, and it was hard to tell if anyone even lives there anymore. The boulder is flush with the ground, according to the description, so it was no surprise that we couldn't spot it from the edge of the yard. We'll try again in winter or if the grass is cut at some point.
    
    
    We went a bit further to turn around, and we came across a pretty spectacular waterfall along Tinker Creek!
