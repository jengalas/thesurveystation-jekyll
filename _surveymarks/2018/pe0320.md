    N 145 was our first attempt during this pleasant, relaxed afternoon spent
    searching for benchmarks we had overlooked in the past. We found a small
    flat ledge in the general location of the mark as described, about level
    with road. There was nothing visible on top and no other obvious ledges that
    looked like good candidates. The area is overgrown and the immediate
    shoulder of the road is sandy. Without much more to go on, I'm not sure if
    this one is worth coming back for with our metal detector and tools.
