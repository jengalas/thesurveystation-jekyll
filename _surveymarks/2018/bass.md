    BASS 2014 is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers disk set at the wharf along Rice Road where we found two survey markers ([TIDAL 4 STA 13](/surveymarks/pe0311/) and [TIDAL 6 STA 13](/surveymarks/pe0307/)) last year. We did investigate all around the wharf at that time, so it's a bit of a mystery how we could have missed this mark that was supposedly set in 2014.  We drove right up to it today and found the mark in excellent condition. I took my photos in the misty rain and Rich found a lovely harbor scene for a photo as well.
