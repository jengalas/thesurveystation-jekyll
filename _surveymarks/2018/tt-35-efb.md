    Rich and I had one more stop on our way from Point Phillips to Northampton
    Community College. I was hoping to find another USGS disk in the “EFB”
    series, like 36 EFB that we found earlier today. But this one wasn't to be.
    The coordinates led us to a driveway between a garage and a house, and
    although we found one small concrete foundation adjacent to the garage, it
    didn't contain a disk. Nothing else appeared to be a likely spot, so we
    marked this one “not found” and continued on down the road.
