    This was a strange one. There is a small wooded triangle of land at the intersection of Route 102 and Seal Cove Road. It was thickly overgrown but I worked my way in and found a nice large outcropping rock that looked perfect for a benchmark. But try as I might, I could not spot it anywhere. The exposed part of the ledge was the obvious first candidate but I was able to rule that out with a glance. After that, well, I didn't have any tools for digging (and all the sticks nearby were rotten and fell apart in my hand). It's very likely buried beneath a thick accumulation of pine needles and leaves. We'll need at least a trowel and maybe also a metal detector when we come back for this one.
    
    
    Interestingly, Joe Coffey of Patriot Land Surveyors recovered this mark in 2010. It must have grown in quickly to be obscured already.
