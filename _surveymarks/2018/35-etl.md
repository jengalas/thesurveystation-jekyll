    This area still resembles the description closely, and there's a very good
    chance the mark is still in place. There is even still a utility pole in the
    proper location, although it now has a different number. The grass in the
    field was very high today, and we couldn't spot a boulder (it probably
    doesn't project much, if at all, above the surface of the ground), so in the
    interest of avoiding ticks we decided to come back and search in the winter.
    I'm kicking myself that I didn't realize that the reference mark is a PDH
    disk on a nearby bridge! We will definitely have to look for that disk soon.
