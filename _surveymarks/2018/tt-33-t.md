    This mark, closest to home, was the first of the seven we attempted on this
    Memorial Day. We had spotted some very auspicious boulders and outcrops when
    we looked at the Google Street View, but in person the site looked quite
    different. Everything is lush and overgrown since it's May, and it has been
    very wet lately.  Also invisible on the Street View was the steep ravine and
    small creek that we would likely have to cross to search for the mark. This
    little patch of woods is undeveloped and the mark is very likely still in
    place, but we'll need to come back in early winter or early spring (whenever
    the vegetation is down and the area is snow-free) to be able to search the
    site. It is likely that the reference mark, the chiseled square, is on one
    of the large boulders we identified.
