    This was another easy benchmark find for today. You can see it from quite a
    distance; it's right where the description specifies (though I found the
    given coordinates to be around 200 feet off). It's in excellent condition,
    and I was happy for the chance to duck inside the doorway for a minute to
    get out of the wind and snow. The courthouse is a lovely old building, and
    the square with its monuments and lawns was almost as pretty on this snowy
    afternoon as it would be on a sunny summer day.
