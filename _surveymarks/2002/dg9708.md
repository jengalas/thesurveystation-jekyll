  The plaque at this site (along with the associated survey marker) is the subject of the virtual geocache [Epicenter](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCA189), which is why we visited the Delaware and Hudson Canal Park today.


  _Update (April 2025)_: I just now discovered that this marker is in the NGS database; interestingly, it was monumented in 2003, a year after we found it. I assume that is the date it was entered into the database.
