    This was an easy find on a very cold and windy Sunday! I parked quite a distance down the road and walked along ice-covered sidewalks to the viaduct. The benchmark is easy to spot and is in good condition. This is a special one for me because my grandmother was born in Lanesboro and lived there until 1930. I remember going to Lanesboro see her old house when I was very young, and the viaduct made an impression on me even then.
