    After a few failed attempts to locate certain benchmarks today (I believe
    they're gone due to the new housing developments), I decided to try for this
    one. It sounded like a sure bet, and I wanted to find at least one more
    marker before heading home. It was a little tricky finding a spot to park
    but I finally found something acceptable, and I dashed across the road to
    locate the marker. This one was even easier than [LY1292](/surveymarks/ly1292/)â€”it was right on top of the wall along
    the side of the bridge. No way you could miss it! Got a few photos here too,
    and there was water in this creek.
