    This benchmark was an easy find; not only was there fluorescent pink paint
    surrounding the marker, but there was also pink tape just above the marker
    on the guard rail and on the bridge. The heavy volume of traffic made it
    challenging enough just getting to the location. The coordinates seem to be
    slightly off, but the description is adequate. The marker is in good
    condition; I wish I could've cleaned it off a little better for the photo,
    but I felt that the traffic was a little too close and I didn't want to
    spend too much time in this spot. It's neat to think that this marker may
    have been used relatively recently.
