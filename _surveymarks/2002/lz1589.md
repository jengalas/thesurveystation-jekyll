    The school is undergoing some massive construction, and it's possible the
    marker is gone. The area was bordered by No Trespassing signs, so I didn't
    venture far into the lot and could not get to the area described. It's
    possible that some structures remain intact beyond the excavated portion of
    the lot, and I'd like to go back and check once this project is over with,
    just to be sure.
