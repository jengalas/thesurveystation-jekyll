  Not sure if I found this one. There is a hole drilled in rock just where the
  description specifies, but no definite marker anywhere to be found. This is
  located on a rocky ledge between two streets, which appears to be used as a
  path. So the disk may have been found and tampered with long ago. The
  coordinates also appear to be far off (the ones listed on the site and the
  datasheet are for a point about .75 miles away from the point described!),
  and I can't find an explanation for this. The coordinates I got were N 41°
  23.554' W 075° 39.799'. If anyone can confirm that I'm right or that I'm
  totally off, please let me know!
