  While vacationing on M.D.I. this Summer I planned to search for a few local
  benchmarks. This one, however, is in a secured location within the Bluenose
  ferry terminal and a U.S. Customs facility. With all the hoopla over
  suspicious and/or potentially illegal activities since the 9/11/2001
  terrorist attacks, and without an official reason for being there I decided
  simply to pass up finding this mark. ~Rich in NEPA~
