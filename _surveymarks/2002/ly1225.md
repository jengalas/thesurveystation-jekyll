    This benchmark was on the way home from the “Delaware Rock Show” cache, and
    I had a feeling it would be an easy one. I found it just as described and in
    very good condition. It's located on top of the only real boulder in the
    church yard, right down by the road. You can't miss it. A church service was
    beginning as I arrived and I got a few strange looks, but no one bothered
    me.

    This vertical control station is located on the top surface of a large outcropping boulder close to the road in the front lawn of Good Shepard Church on Gumbletown Road, east of the intersection of Rt. 402. The historical description leads reliably to the station. At the station mark a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated 36.8 feet from the scaled NGS datasheet coordinates. The disk is in very good condition and the stamped designation is legible, but it does not precisely match the official designation on the datasheet. Instead, it reads: P.T. STA. NO. 6Y. 1925. ~Rich in NEPA~
