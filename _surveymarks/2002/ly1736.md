    There's nothing like an easy find in the snow to set a good mood for the
    day. After a little detour due to the bridge construction in Hallstead, we
    found the intersection easily and the flower urn was impossible to miss.
    Just a few feet away was the monument with the disk in very good condition,
    sticking up out of the snow and marked by a wooden stake. There's plenty of
    ice in the river and with the mountains in the background it was a beautiful
    setting, especially since the sun was shining brilliantly as I took the
    photos and made a note of the coordinates.
