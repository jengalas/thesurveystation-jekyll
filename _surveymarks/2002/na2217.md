    We were on our way to locate benchmarks [NA1433](/surveymarks/na1433/) and [NA1434](/surveymarks/na1434/), and the church provided a convenient
    lot in which to park. So I figured I might as well get some photos of the
    spire and log this one too, even though I generally prefer finding the
    actual benchmark disks. The spire (and the church itself) is an impressive
    landmark in an otherwise run-down area. The abandoned storefronts along
    Chenango Street across from the church were a sad reminder of better times,
    and the downtown area looked even more desolate and forgotten in the snow.
