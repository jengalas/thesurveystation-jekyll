  Well, I struck out on this one. It's supposed to be right across the road from the parking area for BOK Joy, so after finding that cache I thought I'd spend a few minutes looking for the benchmark disk. I was being watched (details in my cache log) so I didn't feel overly comfortable wandering around for <i>too</i> long; but I looked as hard as I could for a good amount of time. Thorns and poison ivy can't stop me! But I found nothing but an old concrete gamelands marker post. I'm so curious about this BM! Is it still here? I'd love to come back in the winter when some of the weeds will be gone and the forest will be easier to tromp around in. I'd love to find this thing!
