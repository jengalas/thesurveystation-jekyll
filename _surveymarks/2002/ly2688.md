  _**Status: Station Mark and RM 1 Found. RM 2 and Azimuth Mark Not Found.**_
  

  Found the station easily; coordinates were good and the directions were perfect. In order to find reference marker 1, I walked about 23 feet east from the station and looked around, expecting to find the disk. I didn't see it, and it took me a minute to realize I was standing on it! It's actually the second time that's happened to me. I was unable to find the second reference mark. I think I may have found the rock that the azimuth marker is located on, but it was covered with several inches of packed dirt and I wasn't able to get down to the surface of the rock. Now I'm on a mission! I want to find the other two disks.
