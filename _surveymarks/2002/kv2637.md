  Came down the road to try for this one after being unable to locate [KV2636](/surveymarks/kv2636/). This marker appears to be on private property, though it's possible it may be close enough to the road that it can be seen and photographed easily. Again I was being watched; this is a difficult area in which to remain inconspicuous (do these people go to work?!). I'll have to try again once I'm better able to pinpoint the location.
