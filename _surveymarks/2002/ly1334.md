  I wandered down to the Italian festival, right on Courthouse Square, this
  evening for dinner and to get a photo of this plaque and bolt! It was a
  challenge because so many people were milling about. Probably no one noticed
  me leaning over the bushes and taking photos of the side of the courthouse
  wall; weirder things are seen here every day at lunchtime. The elevation
  according to my GPS was 780 ft.
