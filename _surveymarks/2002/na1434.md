    This was our fourth and final benchmark of the day. I think Aaron was glad
    that it was so obvious, because he was getting cold (that's what happens
    when you forget your gloves). This monument stuck up above the snow and was
    just as described. It is in good condition. Time to run back to the car! Too
    bad that cafe closed while we were hunting benchmarks; we were looking
    forward to a little snack.
