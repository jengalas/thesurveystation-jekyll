    I was right across the street two days ago looking for the I80/I81 Travel
    Bug Hotel cache, but I didn't have the benchmark printout with me. Went back
    today and found it pretty easily (lots of dirt and leaves covered it, but it
    was right where the description specified). The marker itself looks to be in
    decent condition, but it's difficult to tell. The catch basin grate rests
    right on top of it! The Stage Coach Inn still exists and it appears
    interesting, if somewhat otherworldly.
