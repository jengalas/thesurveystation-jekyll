    Found this one this afternoon after locating two geocaches in the area. I
    was pretty sure which bridge I was looking for, but there wasn't a great
    spot to park, and I had to drive around for a while. Finally I found a
    suitable parking area up the road a bit, and I ran down to the bridge. Well,
    this one wasn't so easy! I knew where to look, but that area was covered
    with a whole lot of gravel and dirt. This was a very tricky spot in which to
    balance, and with the traffic whizzing by overhead it was somewhat
    unnerving. Still, I felt comfortable enough to take the time to dig out the
    markâ€”it was under about an inch of gravel and, I discovered as I dug away at
    it, something black and greasy and filthy. Coordinates were not perfect, but
    with the excellent description they weren't really needed. I managed to take
    a few photos before sliding down the hill!
