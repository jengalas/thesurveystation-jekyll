    Found it this warm, rainy day after picking up our Status Crow reward cache
    across the river. We parked in the Resort Point Overlook lot and I crossed
    Route 611 to look for the marker. The coordinates were a few hundred feet
    off, and the sign mentioned in the description is no longer there (a similar
    sign exists, but it's apparently been moved a few feet up the road). Still,
    the marker was quite easy to find. As I was stepping over weeds and brambles
    by the side of the highway, some self-appointed constable drove up and was
    eyeing every car in the parking lot (I found out later). He questioned Aaron
    about what I was doing across the street! This marker is in a very exposed
    location very close to the road—it can even be seen when you drive by if you
    know where to look. I had to get a little closer to take the photo, but it
    wasn't as if I was scaling the hillside. I wasn't aware it required a permit
    to walk along the side of the road! Some people need to mind their own
    business. When I crossed back to the lot, he was still there but didn't say
    anything to me. I ignored him, took a few photos, and we left—one benchmark
    richer, completely soaked, and with a semi-interesting story to tell!
