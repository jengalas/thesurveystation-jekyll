  Pretty hard not to find this one if you've found KV3866! These towers
  certainly aren't as exciting as the disks (at least, they're not to me) but
  I thought I might as well log this anyway. I originally visited in June with
  Mike and Aaron after finding the 'In Memorium' geocache. I came back in
  October with Rich for a day of mountain biking and we decided to ride up to
  the tower. I'm using the June date for my log because the photos were taken
  then.
