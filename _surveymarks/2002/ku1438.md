    This was our first New York City benchmark find. I figured this would be an
    easy one, but we've learned not to trust the coordinates for most of these
    benchmarks. So when we got to Columbus Circle, Aaron headed right for a
    stone bench, where he sat down and took out my binder of cache and benchmark
    printouts. Right then, I spotted the diskâ€”on the wall directly behind his
    head! According to my GPS, the coordinates and elevation were close, and the
    description was right on (except that I wouldn't call the wall pink). The
    disk is in excellent condition.
