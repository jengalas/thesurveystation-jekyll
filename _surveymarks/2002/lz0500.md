    I was staying in Troy this weekend and decided to search for a few local
    benchmarks. This one seemed like a likely candidate. I started out very
    early in the morning and located the abandoned railroad bed with no trouble.
    But the only landmark mentioned was a stone foundation I couldn't find; I
    knew better than to depend much on the coordinates; and the vegetation in
    the area was so thick (and sharp!) I didn't think I had much of a chance of
    seeing or getting near the mark. I walked up the railroad bed for some time
    and, not finding anything of interest or even a likely starting point,
    turned around and headed back. It was then that through the thorns and
    branches I spotted what looked like a stone wallâ€”and not at all far from the
    location given by the coordinates! Well, I just had to check it out, so I
    fought my way through and, once out on the foundation, saw the disk
    immediately. It's in very good condition, and coordinates and altitude were
    good.
