    Found it late this afternoon after locating the nearby 'Chipmunk Haven'
    geocache. This was a very easy marker to find, and there's a convenient spot
    to park just a few feet from the bridge. I ran over to the bridge, hopped
    over the guardrail and found the benchmark immediately; I took a few quick
    photos as the traffic rushed by beside me. (It seemed more like Interstate
    81 than County Road 45024!) Coordinates weren't a bad match, but the
    description was right on and that's what led me directly to the mark.
