    Right across the way from [KU1438](/surveymarks/ku1438/). I'm
    quite sure I found the right location and the marker, but I can't say
    exactly whether it's in proper condition. It's located exactly where the
    description specifiesâ€”in the middle of the top step on the northeast side of
    the monument. I don't see a designation of 828, but there is a B stamped in
    the top.
