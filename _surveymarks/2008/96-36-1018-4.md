    Here is yet another relatively new PennDOT mark set in a bridge over Sterry
    Creek in Jessup. I found this one on a walk around the neighborhood. My
    friend Alison, who grew up on the next street, actually drove by and saw me
    while I was recovering this mark, so I was able to show her one in person.
    In addition to the disk in the bridge, a nail (surrounded by a painted
    orange triangle) is set nearby on the sidewalk. This is where Rich saw some
    surveyors working just a few days after I found this mark. The disk is in
    good condition.
