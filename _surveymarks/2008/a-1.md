    Today has been full of pleasant surprises. This small survey disk was the
    first thing to draw my eye (well, perhaps other than the awesome cliff
    dwelling) when we arrived at Spruce Tree House for our little self-guided
    tour. The disk is well-worn, but it appears to have been stamped “A 1”.
