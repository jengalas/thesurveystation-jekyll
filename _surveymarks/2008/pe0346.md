    Rich and I spent the day at the far reaches of Acadia National Park—the
    section of the park on Isle au Haut. It's quite a haul to reach the island,
    involving a drive to Stonington and then a ferry ride to Isle au Haut Town
    Landing. Needless to say, after a full day of sightseeing and hiking, we
    were looking for a nice supper. We remembered seeing a place in Blue Hill
    called the Blue Moose. What could be more perfect for us?! There was even a
    big blue moose “sculpture” (for lack of a better word) on the front porch.
    Our meal was excellent and the place was quiet enough to allow us a chance
    to reflect on our day. With moose-bellies full, we began to walk back to the
    car and I happened to spot this benchmark disk on the curb of a bridge just
    across the street. It's in very good condition with just some fine scratches
    on the surface.
