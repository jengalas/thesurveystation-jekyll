    Stuffed full of lobster (and wine) after lunch at Beal's, we headed up
    Cadillac Mountain to search for a few old chiseled squares along the
    mountain road. We found this one quite easily on the ledges near the apex of
    the last horseshoe curve near the summit. It was highlighted by black lichen
    that has grown in the chiseled depression, so it was easier to spot than we
    expected. For an old chiseled square constantly exposed to the elements,
    it's in quite good condition. Probably doesn't matter too much as it's
    highly unlikely that this mark will be used again (U.E. = “useless
    elevation,” according to Dave Doyle).
