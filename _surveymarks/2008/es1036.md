    Crazy though we may have been, after this morning's drenching in a wild monsoon thunderstorm at Bell Rock, Rich and I were willing to try one more hike on this weird-weather Wednesday. I'm not sure how or when we decided on Scheurman Mountain; I know we were encouraged by the relatively short length of the trail and the fact that we might have a decent chance at getting under cover should another storm hit. It would also take us close to the Red Rock Loop Road, which we wanted to explore.
    
    
    
    By the time we reached the parking area behind the school, the sky above us was clear and the sun was strong and hot. We began organizing our packs for the hike. Water, rain shell just in case, cameras, map ... datasheet ... GPS? “Rich, do you have the GPS?” “Oh ... no ...” he responded, as he realized that it was still in our motel room.
