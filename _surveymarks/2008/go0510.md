    While we were exploring the Four Corners monument, we simply had to wander
    just a bit away from the main attraction to look for this Supreme Court
    mark.  It's the first Supreme Court marker we have found, and we're very
    interested to learn more about why they were set. The disk is about a tenth
    of a mile east of the Four Corners monument ([CO UT AZ NM](/surveymarks/ad9256/)) and
    is on the boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico. The disk is in
    excellent condition and was crossed with white vinyl at the time of our
    visit in preparation for aerial surveying (we suspect).
