    When we read through the USGS datasheets for Maine, we were excited to see
    so many benchmarks we had been unaware of before. There's one very close to
    the Jordan Pond House, famous stop for popovers in the park! The woods were
    damp and dark today, and it took us a little longer to spot the disk than it
    may have on a brighter day, but once we found the correct boulder, the disk
    stood right out. It's set on a shelf that protrudes slightly above the
    surface of the rest of the boulder, and possibly because of that, the mark
    was clear of the pine debris that had settled atop the rest of the boulder.
    The boulder is just a few yards into the woods from the Jordan Pond House,
    the side of which is visible through the trees from the site of the mark.
    The disk is in excellent condition.
