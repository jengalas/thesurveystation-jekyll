    Our afternoon adventures included finding two topographic station disks (LOP
    and DUKY) on the western side of the island, and then driving over to Bass
    Harbor Head to check out the lighthouse and hang out on the rocks for a
    while. Believe it or not, we found yet another NPS boundary marker on the
    way! It's located in the southeast corner of the intersection of Lighthouse
    Road, which heads south toward the lighthouse, and Arnold Road, heading
    east. Like many others we've found, this NPS disk is unstamped, and is set
    into the top of a granite post. It is in good condition and is marked by an
    orange NPS witness post.
