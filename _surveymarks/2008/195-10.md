    It's exciting to have the USGS datasheets, because now we know about even
    more benchmarks on MDI! This one is only a U.E., but it's in an interesting
    location in the woods at Kebo Valley Golf Course. It's a chiseled square, so
    we knew it could be a challenge to find, but it could also be a lot of fun.
    Turns out it was a surprisingly easy find on a large boulder. Unlike many
    other such chiseled squares, the surface of the boulder was clear of moss
    and forest debris so the carving really stood out.
