    This is one big benchmark disk! It's also one of the best-known, because
    probably hundreds of people per week visit the Four Corners just to stand on
    this spot. In 1992, the original Four Corners monument ([FOUR CORNERS=GLO STA
    1](/surveymarks/go0497/)) was destroyed and it was replaced with this large (8-inch diameter)
    disk. An elaborate stone platform surrounds the disk. The land is owned by
    the Navajo Nation, and there's typically a variety of stands set up around
    the monument platform where the Navajo people sell arts & crafts and food
    items (I wholeheartedly recommend the fry bread with honey!).
