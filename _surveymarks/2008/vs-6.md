    We happened to spot this USGS benchmark disk while walking out to the
    Kachina Point Overlook in Petrified Forest National Park. It is set into an
    outcropping just a few feet east of the walkway. The disk and outcropping
    are in good condition. I always enjoy finding these old USGS marks, and this
    one is in a particularly beautiful spot near the old Painted Desert Inn.
