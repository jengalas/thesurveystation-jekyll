    As most lighthouses are, this was a very easy find and a beautiful sight. We
    first spotted and photographed it in the morning, as we rode the mail boat
    to Isle au Haut for a day of hiking. At that time, it was a typical gray,
    misty Maine morning. By the time of our return trip in the afternoon, the
    sky was completely clear and blue and the lighthouse looked radiant in the
    sunshine.
