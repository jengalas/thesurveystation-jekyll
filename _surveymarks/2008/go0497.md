    This was the original Four Corners monument. In 1992 it was destroyed and
    replaced with the current monument (as of our visit in 2008), [CO UT AZ NM](/surveymarks/ad9256/)
    (AD9256). We took a quick look for the reference marks and found one of
    them, RM 2, on the open land west of the four corners station.
