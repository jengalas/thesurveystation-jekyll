type: Triangulation Station Disk
setting: Square Concrete Monument
year_established: 1936

status: Recovered
condition: Good  
ngs_report: true
ngs_report_text: The station and reference mark 1 were recovered in good condition. The monument into which RM 2 is set has cracked and the soil surrounding the monument has undergone severe erosion, exposing all four sides of the concrete to a depth of about 20 inches. The monument appears to be straight and stable, but it may have shifted. The azimuth mark was not searched for. The witness post is still in place. Interstate 40 now follows the path of the former U.S. Highway 66 in this area. Access the mark via the Petrified Forest exit from I-40 (exit 311). Follow Park Road in a generally northeasterly direction for approximately 1 mile to a park service road on the right. Follow the service road approximately 0.6 miles northeasterly to the station and reference marks on the right.

  This has to be one of the most beautiful, colorful triangulation station locations! It's easy to see here how the Painted Desert earned its name. Low hills of red, yellow, and many shades of green stretch in all directions, beneath a clear blue sky, and lavender wildflowers dot the near landscape. It's interesting to imagine what the old zoo and curio shop across the road must have looked like.


  This was a relatively easy mark to reach, requiring just a short hike along the Old Route 66 and then an even shorter cross-desert walk toward the coordinates. The station and reference mark 1 are in very good condition, easy to find and stable. The ground surrounding the monument that holds reference mark 2 has been severely eroded, and although the monument appears to be straight and solid in its setting, there's no way for us to tell for sure. We found an intact witness post near the station, as described. We did not have an opportunity to search for the azimuth mark at this time.
