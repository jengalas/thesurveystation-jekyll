    This is another boundary marker we spotted while driving by. Like some of
    the other NPS boundary markers in Acadia it has no stamped designation, and
    we haven't yet been able to find any information about these disks. This one
    is easy to spot if you look for the brown witness post along the east side
    of Otter Cliff Road about 0.7 miles south of its intersection with Route 3.
    I checked very carefully, and despite appearances ... there's no poison ivy
    near the mark!
