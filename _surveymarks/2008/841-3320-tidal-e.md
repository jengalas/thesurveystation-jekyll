    With Danish, scone, tea and coffee from Morning Glory in hand, we made our
    way to our favorite breakfast spot, the gazebo in Agamont Park. We happened
    to take a slightly different route (up the steps from West Street into the
    park), and to our surprise, we spotted a new tidal station disk set into one
    of the steps! It's only two years old, and is part of the same series we've
    recovered marks from before. (841 3320 is the Bar Harbor tidal station
    designation, and there are at least ten marks in the series set over a
    period of several decadesâ€”some date back to 1975.) This new disk is in very
    good condition; hopefully it stays that way in such an exposed location.
