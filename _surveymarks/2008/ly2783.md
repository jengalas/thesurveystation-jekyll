    Mark not found. A steel 3-legged lattice structure set in a triangular
    concrete base was found at the site. But the mast is significantly shorter
    than 110 feet and has no red light at the top. The original mast has been
    either replaced or modified.

    There has apparently been quite a history of towers and radio masts atop Elk Mountain—not surprising, as Elk is the highest mountain (or “knob”) in this part of the state.  We're not able to confirm that we've found this mast as described, although it seems very likely that it's the mast described in 1959 with some modifications. 
    
    
    This mast's location matches the coordinates, it is a 3-legged steel lattice structure set into a triangular base that shows some age, it is owned by Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and it is painted orange-red and white.  However, this mast is significantly shorter than 110 feet (we estimate its height at 30-40 feet) and there is no red light mounted on top. While it's very likely that this is the same mast described on the datasheet, we can't be sure, and in any case the survey point observed upon (the top of the 110-foot mast) is gone.
