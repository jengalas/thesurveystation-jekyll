    Our loop on the Far View Trail took us past half a dozen Ancestral Puebloan
    structures of varying types. Preservation attempts at Megalithic House have
    included a rather ugly, but still I suppose functional, roofed enclosure.
    Set into the clay soil near Megalithic House we spotted this unstamped NPS
    survey disk. A survey mark set directly into the soil is unusual, to say the
    least. I'm assuming it is set atop a steel rod deeply embedded in the ground
    to add some stability.
