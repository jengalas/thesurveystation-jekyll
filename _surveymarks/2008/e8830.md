    Rich and I spotted this small NPS disk set into the rocky surface of the
    trail to White House Ruins. This is a beautiful, easy hike into a peaceful,
    almost surreal canyon, and I think it's the only hike you can do in Canyon
    de Chelly unaccompanied by a Navajo guide. Orange-red rock glows all around
    you and provides a striking contrast to the lush green valley floor. Finding
    the survey disk was just an added treat while we enjoyed this beautiful
    trail.
