    While on our tour of the Monument Valley area, we just had to stop by at the historic Goulding's Lodge. It was made even more interesting by the fact that there is a benchmark disk set into a corner of the porch! The disk is in excellent condition, and it's in a really excellent location! The colorful surroundings are unbeatable. 
    
    
    We were also touched by the words written by a Pennsylvania couple in the inn's guestbook: “We followed our map across the country to find that where it showed the least, we found the most.”
