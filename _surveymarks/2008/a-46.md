    We unexpectedly found this National Park Service survey marker while driving
    the Mesa Top Loop in Mesa Verde National Park. The disk is set in a tall
    concrete post projecting about 2 feet above the ground, so you really
    couldn't miss it. It is just off the road near one of the excavated
    pithouses. The disk is in excellent condition. I wish we could find a source
    for descriptions of these marks!
