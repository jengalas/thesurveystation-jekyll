    Rich and I spent the day at the far reaches of Acadia National Park—the
    section of the park on Isle au Haut. It's quite a haul to reach the island,
    involving a drive to Stonington and then a ferry ride to Isle au Haut Town
    Landing. Along the way we spotted two landmark stations from the ferry (the
    lighthouse and the church spire). But the main goal of today's hike—other
    than to thoroughly enjoy the exercise and all the scenery around us—was to
    attempt to recover the DUCK HARBOR MOUNTAIN triangulation station. We hiked
    the Duck Harbor Mountain trail and found it to be a beautiful, moderately
    challenging trail with some rock scrambles and exposures on relatively sheer
    cliffs. At the summit we were above the fog, so we were able to enjoy the
    warmth of some strong June sunshine, but the views weren't as expansive as
    they would be on a clear day. Still, the closed-in feeling and the fact that
    we had the entire mountain to ourselves made the whole experience
    particularly special and intimate. All three disks were in excellent
    condition and were found easily using the historical descriptions.
