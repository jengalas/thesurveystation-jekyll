    We were driving through Petrified Forest National Park and admiring the
    tepees when I happened to spot a concrete post in the desert sand a few
    meters off the road. And it just so happened to have a disk on top! This is
    a FHWA survey disk. The type is unspecified, and the disk and monument are
    in good condition. There are other similar ones nearby!
