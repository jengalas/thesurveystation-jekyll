    While on our way along lonely Route 191 from Chinle to Holbrook, we searched
    for the tri-station BEAUTIFUL. The name is quite fitting to the location!
    This is native land, and even walking a short distance off the road felt
    like we were intruding. No one was nearby, and certainly no one bothered us
    while we were searching or documenting the mark. We were able to find the
    station and RM 2 easily, but we had no luck with RM 1. The station disk is
    in good condition, although the monument is slightly eroded on one side (it
    doesn't appear that this has affected its stability). RM 2 was surrounded by
    an “X” made of white plastic, indicating it has likely been used in an
    aerial survey.
