    Rich and I spent the day at the far reaches of Acadia National Parkâ€”the section of the park on Isle au Haut. It's quite a haul to reach the island, involving a drive to Stonington and then a ferry ride to Isle au Haut Town Landing. Needless to say, after a full day of sightseeing and hiking, we were looking for a nice supper. We remembered seeing a place in Blue Hill called the Blue Moose. What could be more perfect for us?! 
    
    
    After relaxing over a delicious meal, we happened to spot not just one (WO 6) but two benchmark disks on a bridge near our car! This one, a MaineDOT survey mark, is set into the sidewalk atop the bridge. The stamping is still legible, although the disk is mildly corroded.
