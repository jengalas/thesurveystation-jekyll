    This one may be a bit of a stretch, since we only saw the steeple from the
    ferry, but we're recovering it anyway since landmark stations were intended
    to be sighted on from a distance. The name of the church is [Union
    Congregation Church](https://www.isleauhautmaine.us/union-congregational-church/). It was built in 1857, so we're quite certain the
    steeple is the same one observed originally in 1868.
