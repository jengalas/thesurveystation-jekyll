    Like A 46 nearby, we found this disk unexpectedly while driving the Mesa Top
    Loop in Mesa Verde National Park. This is in a more standard round concrete
    monument close to the surface of the ground, unlike the high monument that A
    46 is set into. Still, it was in close proximity to the sidewalk leading
    toward the pithouses, and was easy for us to spot. Given that there are two
    markers so close together, I suspect there are more, perhaps set around the
    pithouses for use in some archaeological projects. The disk and monument
    appear to be in very good condition.
