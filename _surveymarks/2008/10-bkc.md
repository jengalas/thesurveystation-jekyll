    Two of the attractions on today's journey from Oak Creek to Kayenta were
    Wupatki and Sunset Crater. While driving on the Sunset Crater-Wupatki Loop
    Road, we noticed several survey mark witness posts! Although we passed at
    least five of these posts, we only stopped to look for two benchmarks. This
    was the first one: 10 BKC. It's unlike many of the others we've found, this
    mark is a disk on a rod set inside a steel pipe. The mark is in very good
    condition.
