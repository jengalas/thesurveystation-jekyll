    This is the third boundary marker we recovered today on our drive around the
    Otter Creek/Otter Cliff Road area. Like the first two, this is an NPS disk
    with no stamped designation, so we gave it one of our own just for
    identification purposes on this website. Like some other boundary disks
    we've found, there are marks chiseled in this one indicating the property
    corner and directions of the boundary lines. This disk is set in a granite
    post on the eastern side of Otter Cliff Road. Although it is marked by an
    orange NPS witness post like many of the other boundary markers we've found
    here, this one is set back a bit from the road and is currently overgrown,
    making it a bit tougher to spot and to photograph. The disk and monument
    appear to be in good condition.
