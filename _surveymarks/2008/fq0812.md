    Two of the attractions on today's journey from Oak Creek to Kayenta were
    Wupatki and Sunset Crater. While driving on the Sunset Crater-Wupatki Loop
    Road, we noticed several survey mark witness posts! Although we passed at
    least five, we only stopped to look for two benchmarks. This was the second
    one: 22 BKC. It's unlike many of the others we've found, this mark is a disk
    on a rod set inside a steel pipe. Condition is very good.
