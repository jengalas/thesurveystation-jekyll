  While on a morning walk around town, we strolled down to the waterfront and checked out a few of the benchmarks there. This mark, the one set at the top of the boat ramp, for some reason has its designation and date Xed out! I've never seen that before, and it certainly wasn't the case the last time we checked on this mark (probably two or three years ago). It seems strange that anyone would cross out the identifying information, because even if the survey data was inaccurate the mark could always be resurveyed.  There are no updates on NOAA's [Tides and Currents datasheet](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/benchmarks.html?id=8413320) for this mark.
