    The drive up Sorber Mountain Road was an interesting one (the road is a
    long, narrow, winding mountain road in quite good condition, considering),
    but I would need better coordinates or description in order to find this
    one, or at least permission from local homeowners to poke around for quite
    some time (assuming they didn't already know where it was). There are a few
    homes right near the coordinates, and there would be no way to search for
    this mark stealthily. I would have to approach the homes and ask for
    permission. That is certainly a possibility at some point, but I didn't have
    time this morning.
