  Everyone knows that I can't resist looking for a benchmark or two whenever I visit a new location. (In many cases, of course, benchmarks are the reason I visit new places!) But today, I was in Connecticut for another primary reason: a memorial celebration for my client, Beverly Willis, who just passed away at the age of 95. Rich and I left the house with plenty of time to spare, just in case traffic was heavy, but we arrived at the Hotel Marcel about an hour and a half before the ceremony was to begin. So, of course, we had a few datasheets prepared.

  This mark, Q 3, is set vertically on the foundation wall of the New Haven Union Station. (We had spotted it ahead of time, actually, on Google Street View.) The railroad station was extremely busy today around noon, but Rich found a place to park across the street and I ran over to photograph the mark. A man was camped out with all kinds of luggage right in front of it, but he moved off to the side when I asked. The disk is in excellent condition, and it was a nice introduction to New Haven benchmark hunting for us!
