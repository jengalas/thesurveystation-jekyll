    This was the second of two USGS marks I'd hoped to find on my way to the annual Death Hike (held this year at Ricketts Glen State Park). When I arrived and saw the style of the bridge, I had some hope, but unfortunately this bridge was replaced in 1957 and the USGS mark, set in 1942, went away with the old bridge. 


    I was pleased, however, to see that USGS had reset the mark (see [AMD 3 RESET 1958](/surveymarks/amd-3-1942-reset-1958/)) in 1958, in the same location.
