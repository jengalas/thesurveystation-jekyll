    This USGS bench mark sounded interesting, but I was skeptical before I even
    began my trip today based on what I saw on the Street View. My fears were
    confirmed. There is really nowhere safe to park or walk along this very
    narrow road with no shoulders, and the ledge must be one of many in the
    heavily wooded area east of Buckwheat Hollow Road. I may try again if Rich
    is with me, but this morning I didn't have the time or inclination to poke
    around in that area. This may also be easier in the colder seasons when
    there is less vegetation.
