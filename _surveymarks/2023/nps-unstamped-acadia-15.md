    This was the sixth and final boundary marker I found today while hiking in
    the Kittredge Brook Forest Preserve. This mark is located along the
    Kittredge Brook Trail, at the northernmost point along that trail where
    Acadia National Park land touches the preserve. The disk is in fair
    condition, with some corrosion on its surface. Like most of the other disks
    here, it also has some scratches in the middle that may have been an attempt
    to give it some kind of designation, but it is unstamped.
