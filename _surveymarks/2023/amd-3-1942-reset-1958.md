    I was sad to see that the original disk was gone (since the bridge was
    replaced 15 years after it was set), but it was so cool to see a reset USGS
    mark in its place! For some reason, the reset is stamped AMD 3 instead of 3
    AMD. It is in very good condition on the northeast wingwall of the bridge
    along Route 29. There is plenty of room just west of the bridge to park, the
    shoulder is wide, and there is plenty of room to stand on the other side of
    the guard rail here. It was also neat to see that this mark was apparently
    used recently: there was a small twig set into the ground with a piece of
    blue flagging tape right next to the mark. There was also something unusual
    set in the steeply-sloping wingwall behind the PDH plaque: two coins
    embedded in the concrete, one of which was a special edition Lewis & Clark
    nickel from 2005. So that concrete, at least, must have been repaired or
    patched quite recently.
