  I had no idea that today's hike in the Kittredge Brook Preserve would bring me to six NPS boundary markers! This one, the first, is located right at the point where the Vernal Pool splits into a trail heading west and then north, and a trail heading directly north (which is the one I took). Little did I know that the northbound trail follows a boundary with Acadia National Park, hence all of the boundary markers that kept appearing before me on the trail. All of them were accompanied by orange witness posts. This disk is in good condition.
