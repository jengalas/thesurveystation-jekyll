    This PennDOT mark was what I found in place of the 1942 USGS bench mark disk
    (38 B) that I had hoped to find in this location. The bridge is obviously
    much newer than 1942, so it wasn't too surprising. This mark is set in the
    west wingwall, just as the USGS mark was. It is in good condition. As we
    have noted from previous stamped PennDOT marks, the designation indicates
    the year (1998), the [county](/assets/docs/publications/PennDOTCountyLookup.pdf)
    (65: Wyoming County), the route number (SR 0292), and the number of the mark
    on that route or line.
