    This bench mark sounded really interesting to me; I like the descriptions
    that involve old schoolhouses! As is typical, though, there is nothing left
    of this one, and I searched all around the area of the coordinates without
    find any rocks, boulders, or ledges of any kind (other than one small
    outcropping that was clear of all debris and definitely had no mark on it).
    I will attempt to do some research. Perhaps an old aerial image will give me
    a better idea of what this spot was like when the mark was set.
