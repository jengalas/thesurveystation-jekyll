    This was the fifth of six boundary markers I found today in Kittredge Brook
    Forest Preserve. It's located along the Kittredge Brook Trail, not long
    after it heads northwest from the Vernal Pool Loop. The disk is in good
    condition, and like others in this area it has a scratch in the center that
    may have served as some kind of marking, although it is unstamped.
