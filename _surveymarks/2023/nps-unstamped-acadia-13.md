    This is the third of six NPS boundary markers I found on today's hike in the
    Kittredge Brook Forest Preserve. It is close to the spot where the Pine
    Ridge Loop diverges from the Vernal Pool Loop to head toward Long Heath.
    Like the others in this area, the disk is in fairly good condition, and the
    adjacent orange witness post makes it easy to spot.
