    This was the second benchmark we found today in New Haven, and unfortunately it wasn't in such a great location. This was another mark, like the one on the railroad station, that we could see from Google Street View, so at least I didn't have to spend much time poking around looking for it. My first thought was that this area was a homeless encampment, but it may have just been a dumping spot for trash. In any case, I didn't want to hang around there for too long, so I documented the mark and moved on. For being relatively exposed, the disk is in good condition. It has been used in the not-too-distant past, as evidenced by the “BM” painted on the concrete
    nearby.
