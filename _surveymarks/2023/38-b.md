    This year's Death Hike was in a new location: Ricketts Glen State Park. It takes exactly the same time for me to reach the park via the back roads as it does via the highway, so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to take a more scenic route and search for a few benchmarks along the way. 


    My journey began at 7:00 this morning, and 38 B was my first target. There is plenty of safe parking at this spot, but unfortunately as soon as I arrived I had my doubts about finding this mark. The bridge in this location is clearly much newer than 1942, and unless the deck was replaced without touching the wingwalls (which sometimes happens) I figured I would be out of luck.


    I was correct; 38 B is no more, and neither is the chiseled cross that served as a reference mark. But I did find a relatively new PennDOT disk set into the west wingwall of the bridge.
