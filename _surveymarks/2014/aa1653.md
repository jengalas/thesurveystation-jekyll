    Our first goal for today was to check out the Southernmost Point monument,
    hopefully before the majority of tourists arrived. A few groups beat us
    there, but before long we were able to have our photo taken at the monument
    and, more importantly, were able to poke around to search for what remains
    of the benchmark there (after waiting patiently for a break in the action,
    and taking some photos for other groups). Unfortunately the disk is gone (it
    was last seen in 2008), but the stem is still in place and the impression
    left by the disk is still apparent in the concrete. It's always sad to see
    this. The benchmark has been marked Destroyed in the NGS database, and it's
    very unlikely that it will be replaced.
