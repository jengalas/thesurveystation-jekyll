    This afternoon we rode the touristy Conch Train and quite enjoyed it. At the
    train's first stop, we hopped off and ran across the street to recover TIDAL
    24 on the Fairvilla building. We found it very amusing that the benchmark is
    adjacent to a “sexy lingerie” sign! The disk is set vertically in what is
    now the Fairvilla building at the corner of Front and Ann Streets. It is in
    good condition with legible stamping.
