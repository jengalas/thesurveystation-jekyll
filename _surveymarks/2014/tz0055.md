    I was really looking forward to checking out this landmark station. Not only
    is it a neat old lighthouse set atop Fort Jefferson, but it has one of most
    beautiful 360Â° views imaginable! We were enjoying exploring the old fort,
    taking our time poking around as we looked for an open set of steps that
    would lead us to the top of the fort and eventually the lighthouse. This
    lighthouse is actually the second one on this spot. The first was a conical
    brick tower built around 1825. This boilerplate iron tower replaced the
    original tower in 1877, and is therefore the same one referred to in the
    landmark station description (first observed in 1901).
