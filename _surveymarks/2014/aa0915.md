    We had a series of four benchmarks to search for at the White Street Pier.
    The first, 872 4557 TIDAL 3,  was very easy to find; I knew exactly where to
    look because I had “cheated” and spotted it beforehand on Google Street
    View. It's set into the top of the curb at the northeast corner of the pier.
    The disk is in good condition.
