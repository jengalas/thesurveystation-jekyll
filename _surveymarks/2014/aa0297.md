    After spending the morning on Pigeon Key, which we accessed by boat tour
    from the visitors center, we walked back to our car along the Old Seven Mile
    Bridge.  At the eastern end of the bridge we noticed a signup stand for
    Friends of Old Seven, a group that raises funds for the preservation and
    continued maintenance of the bridge. We talked with the man at the stand for
    a while and mentioned our interest in survey markers, wondering if he had
    seen the ones we were looking for. This benchmark, Y 69 RESET, was one of
    them. He pointed out the survey markers on the eastern abutment. I always
    appreciate it when people have taken notice of their surroundings and are
    aware of benchmarks before we tell them! We recovered all three marks. Y 69
    RESET is in good condition and is circled with blue paint.
