    After an amazing lunch at Garbo's Grill, we wandered around again in search of a few more benchmarks.  This one, on the Custom House (which is now the Key West Museum of Art and Culture), was a relatively easy find. Just like at the courthouse, this one required diving into the bushes (autograph trees!) in order to find and photograph it. The disk is in good condition.
    
    
    We think the 2002 recovery by the Power Squadron (`RECOVERED IN POOR CONDITION. DISK IS HEAVILY OXIDIZED AND BARELY LEGIBLE.`) is in error. This disk is not heavily oxidized and the designation and date are easily legible. We think they may have instead been referring to [TIDAL 25](/surveymarks/aa0004/) nearby on the old bank building, which is in fact difficult to read.
