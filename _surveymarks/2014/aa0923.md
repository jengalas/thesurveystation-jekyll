    Mark not found. The pool still exists but there is no longer a boat dock at
    the site, and no concrete monument was found at the coordinates. The
    chiseled X and MOSER RM 4 were found. MOSER RM 3 was not found.

    This has to be one of the most beautiful benchmark locations we've ever
    visited! Unfortunately we were unable to find the mark even after wading
    around in the water in search of the monument. The area has changed
    significantly since the mark was described. We found one of the objects used
    as a reference to this mark, which is a chiseled cross set in the concrete
    headwall forming the boundary of the pool. Our guess is that the monument
    may have been destroyed or covered when the boat dock referred to in its
    description was removed.
