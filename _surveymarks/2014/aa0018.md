    This was another easy, fun find on our benchmark tour of Key West. The disk
    is set vertically into the wall surrounding the Key West Lighthouse (also
    listed in the NGS database as a landmark station), at the corner of Truman
    Avenue and Whitehead Street. It is in good condition. The disk was
    apparently painted over with white paint at some point (along with the rest
    of the wall), but the paint was scraped off the designation and date,
    probably to make them more legible.
