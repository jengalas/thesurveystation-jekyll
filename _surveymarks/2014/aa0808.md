    We continued along the old bridge over Channel #2, after finding two
    benchmarks at the northeastern end, and found another one at the
    southwestern end! This tidal disk was also in very good condition and was an
    easy find on the curb of the bridge. The old bridge now serves as part of
    the Heritage Trail and is used for recreational purposes. Vehicle traffic
    uses the new bridge just to the south.
