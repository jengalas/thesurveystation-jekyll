    I happened to spot this benchmark disk on a bridge as we exited the Flamingo
    area of Everglades National Park. According to the data stamped on the disk
    it was set in 1974 by the Jacksonville District of the Army Corps of
    Engineers, but I haven't yet been able to find a datasheet or any further
    description for this mark.
