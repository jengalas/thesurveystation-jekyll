  Two days in a row, we've unexpectedly come across these survey disks set into sidewalks in Key West. I wonder if there is some particular project planned that will depend on the marks. PNC-03 is located at the southeast corner of Windsor Lane and Truman Avenue. Like PNC-01, this is in decent condition for how exposed it is. Also like PNC-01, this disk (according to Google Street View) was set sometime between March 2011 and February 2014, when we found it.
  
  
  **_Update (15 October 2020):_** I no longer see the benchmark in the sidewalk on the Street View as of July 2018. This section of the sidewalk has been replaced.
