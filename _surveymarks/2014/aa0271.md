    This was a fun mark to search for at Bahia Honda State Park. We entered the
    grassy area just north of the old Bahia Honda bridge to find two sets of
    steps leading down toward a small beach. The benchmark disk is located at
    the lower set of steps, set into the top surface of a step. It is in good
    condition—slightly corroded, but still legible. Rich and I explored the
    grassy area further, finding a replica of Flagler's private railcar
    “Rambler,” before heading back up to the bridge.
