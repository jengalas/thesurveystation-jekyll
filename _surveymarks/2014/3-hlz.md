    Our second find on our way to a Fourth of July picnic was 3 HLZ, a USGS mark
    that we somehow never looked for before.  It was an easy find on an old rock
    culvert over a tiny stream along Cortez Road. The disk is in very good
    condition, although the rock culvert wasn't quite what I expected. It is
    made of what appear to be separate granite blocks; it doesn't give the
    typical appearance of stability. There is no sign that the block has been
    moved, but it would be hard to determine this. We didn't notice it at the
    time, but it appears from the photograph that there might be a chiseled
    square on the adjacent block. If so, it may have been used as a reference
    mark, but it is not mentioned on the datasheet. There are three aspects of
    the description that don't quite match up. The culvert actually runs
    east-west, so the disk is on the east end, not the north end. The culvert is
    longer than 4 feet. We couldn't find any sign of the “field rd. E” mentioned
    in the description, nor any indication of it on the historical aerial images
    from PennPilot.
