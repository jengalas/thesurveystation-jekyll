    This Army Corps of Engineers disk is set in the top of the concrete walkway
    around the moat on the western side of Fort Jefferson. It is just slightly
    north of the similar disk FJNHS - 5.  This disk is damaged, with a chunk
    taken out of one side, but it still looks relatively stable and the
    designation is clearly legible.
