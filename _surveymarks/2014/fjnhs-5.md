    This was one of two Army Corps of Engineers disks that we found while
    walking around the perimeter of Fort Jefferson. This one was found at the
    southwesternmost point, embedded in the concrete wall of the moat. The disk
    is in good condition. While documenting this mark, we spotted the fort's
    resident crocodile (which we named Jefferson H. Crocodile III—Jeff, for
    short) swimming back and forth in the moat!
