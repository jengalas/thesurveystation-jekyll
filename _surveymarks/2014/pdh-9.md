    There isn't much to say about this mark. Like many other PennDOT and PDH
    marks, we found it simply by checking out, on a hunch, an old bridge we
    happened to be passing over. It is unstamped and in good condition. We found
    it on a bridge over Marsh Creek along Graveyard Hill Road (great name,
    especially appropriate for the day before Halloween). We were our way to 37
    B (now _that_ was quite a story!). On the side of the bridge facing
    the road is a PDH bridge plaque giving the date of construction as 1961.
