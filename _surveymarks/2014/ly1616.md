    The other marks we intended to search for today were long shots, so we chose
    Z 281 as a confidence booster.  The description is quite definitive, so we
    knew the mark would be easy to findâ€”or at the very least, easy to determine
    if it was gone. After our adventures at St. Catherine's Cemetery (TT 2 J)
    and Knecht's Country Store (X 281), we drove just about 1.2 miles further
    southeast along Route 435 and easily found the concrete bridge over the
    small creek (Tamarack Creek). Rich parked on the west shoulder while I
    crossed and found the mark on the southeast end of the south abutment, as
    described.  The mark is in good condition and is, as described, an old PDH
    disk that was stamped by NGS. The trailer park and pond still exist at this
    location. The utility pole also exists but has been renumbered.
