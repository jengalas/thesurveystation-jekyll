    This was one of the first benchmarks I put on our list for this trip to Florida. I figured it would be easy to find and in a very picturesque location, and it is! It is set into the base of a flagpole at Flamingo Visitor Center. The disk is in good condition.
    
    
    While we were at Flamingo, Rich was telling me about the old Flamingo Lodge. Opened in 1959, it was part of NPS's Mission 66 program and offered cottages and over 100 rooms for visitors. Sadly the lodge was destroyed by hurricanes in 2005, and has not yet been rebuilt.
