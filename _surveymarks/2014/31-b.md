    Our last goal for the day was to search for 31 B, set in a sidewalk of an old farmhouse.  As usual, we previewed the property via Google Satellite View. Check out those gardens and outbuildings! It's like the Country Bellagio! Maybe not quite. But when I was waiting for someone to answer the door, I peeked inside to see a foyer with two pedestals displaying what appeared to be Greek revival busts. Shame no one came to the door, because I would've loved to meet them.
    
    
    Permission wasn't even necessary because the disk is so close to the road that it must be on highway right-of-way, but we still enjoy talking with homeowners about “their” benchmarks. 31 B was found in good condition in the flagstone walk of 105 Church Rd., Wyoming, PA as described.
