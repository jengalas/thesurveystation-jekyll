    This station is set into a concrete pad near the marina at Founders Park in
    Islamoradaâ€”just about 150 feet south-southwest of [872 3776 TIDAL
    1](/surveymarks/aa0934/). It is in good condition and was very easy to locate using the
    description, even though the Bar B Q Pit restaurant is no longer here. 
    There should be at least one more tidal disk in this area, and possibly a
    few more.  Next time, we will be better prepared and will try to find them
    all!
