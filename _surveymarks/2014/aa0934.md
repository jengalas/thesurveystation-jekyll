    This was our first Florida benchmark, and of all the marks we had prepared for, this was not among them.  While waiting for the Islamorada visitors' center to open at 9:00am, we took a walk through the adjacent Founders Park.  This turned out to be a well maintained and interesting municipal park with a beach, walking/cycling paths, dog park, and a full-service marina.  And as a bonus—as I discovered when I checked BenchMap—several tidal stations!
    
    
    No. 1 was easy to locate using the description (although the Bar B Q Pit restaurant is no more) and is in excellent condition.  I took photos while Rich searched the seawall and many walkways of the marina for more disks.
