    On our way back (along the currently detoured route) from our favorite farm
    stand on Route 438, I noticed that this small bridge had been rebuilt, and
    we stopped to look for a disk. We found one set into the new concrete, but
    it has no stamped designation. Rich thinks that PennDOT may be adding disks
    to new bridges just in case they're needed in the future, and not
    necessarily surveying them until a later date. This makes sense to me. We've
    found several unstamped disks in newly-replaced bridges, and I've found a
    few older marks that were unstamped when I first found them, but were later
    stamped. Perhaps next year this mark will be stamped and we'll have an
    update to this page!
