    We returned to Fort Point State Park on a much warmer and drier morning than we experienced here last year. This time, without a foot of water in the ditch (and no poison ivy to wade through—we checked) we were able to access the boulder quite easily (thanks, Rich, for making a path through the weeds for me!).
    
    
    We confirmed what we had suspected last year: that the disk is indeed D 147.  It is in very good condition atop the 6'x3' boulder just north of Lighthouse Road, as described. We saw pink flagging tape tied to a tree branch nearby, so it's likely that a local surveyor has used the mark within the last year.  The tape is visible in the eyelevel photo.
