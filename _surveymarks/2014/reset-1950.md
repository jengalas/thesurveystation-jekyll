    This was our final find on a very successful day of blueberry festivities,
    hiking, and benchmark hunting. When we drove slowly by and I saw this disk,
    I was sure we had found 24 ETL. The disk was obviously one of the thick
    “cookie-style” USGS disks and not a new PennDOT disk, and it was in the
    correct wingwall as specified by the USGS description. But when we checked,
    we found that although the disk is indeed a USGS benchmark, it is not 24
    ETL. It's stamped only RESET 1950. We assume that it is a reset of 24 ETL
    although that's not certain. According to PennDOT's bridge database, this
    bridge was constructed in 1952, which doesn't really help to clear things
    up. It's possible the bridge took a few years to be completed and that the
    mark was set at the beginning of the project.
