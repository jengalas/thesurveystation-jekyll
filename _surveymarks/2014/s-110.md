    We were returning to Jordan Pond House along the carriage road after hiking
    about half of the Seaside Path. We had already found two boundary markers
    and enjoyed hiking what was, for us, a new trail. The afternoon's mist was
    turning to drizzle when I spotted an unmarked trail, possibly an old woods
    road, leading north from the carriage road. Near the intersection, we found
    yet another NPS boundary marker! This mark is stamped S 110 and its witness
    post is brown, similar to others we've found in the past but unlike the
    others we found today, which were orange. I suspect that they're used
    interchangeably, or maybe one style is newer than the other. Now we need to
    find S 111, S 112, and S 113!
