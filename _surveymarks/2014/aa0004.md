    legible.

    This benchmark is set vertically in the brick wall of a very colorful former
    bank building on the corner of Front and Duval Streets. The building now
    houses a clothing and souvenir shop. We actually spotted this mark on our
    post-dinner walk last night , but it was too dark then to photograph it. The
    disk is in fairly good condition for being so exposed. Although the stamping
    is difficult to discern, it is still legible.
