    After this morning's hike, Rich, Dad and I had plenty of time to walk around
    Easton and continue to work up an appetite for lunch.  There may not be all
    that much to see in this section of Easton, but we did hope to find the
    three bench marks on the grounds of the courthouse.  This was the first one,
    and we walked right up to it—you really can't miss it, since it's set into
    the Spanish American War monument on the lawn just north of the courthouse.
    The disk is set solidly into the west corner of the monument and is in good
    condition. As noted in the 2009 recovery, the monument is actually at the
    northeast corner of the courthouse lawn rather than the southeast.
