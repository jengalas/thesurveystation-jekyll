    This is becoming too easy! There are at least three disks set into the
    eastern abutment of the old railroad bridge that is accessible from Bahia
    Honda State Park. We found several others on the south wingwall, and D 70 on
    the north wingwall.  Although there are some cracks in the concrete, the
    disk still seems stable and in very good condition.
