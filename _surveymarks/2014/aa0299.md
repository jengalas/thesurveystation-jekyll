    After spending the morning on Pigeon Key, which we accessed by boat tour
    from the visitors center, we walked back to our car along the Old Seven Mile
    Bridge.  At the eastern end of the bridge we noticed a signup stand for
    Friends of Old Seven, a group that raises funds for the preservation and
    continued maintenance of the bridge. We talked with the man at the stand for
    a while and mentioned our interest in survey markers, wondering if he had
    seen the ones we were looking for (KNIGHT 2 and its one remaining reference
    mark, and an unrelated benchmark Y 69 RESET). He pointed out the survey
    markers on the eastern abutment. I always appreciate it when people have
    taken notice of their surroundings and are aware of benchmarks before we
    tell them! We recovered all three marks—one of which, KNIGHT 2, was in a
    rather precarious spot—without any problems. The reference mark for KNIGHT 2
    is only about 10 feet away from the station itself.
