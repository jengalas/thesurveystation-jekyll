    By the time Rich and I arrived at the intersection of Margaret Hollow Rd. (T
    340) and Creamery Rd. (SR 2005), our lovely fall day had turned dark,
    chilly, and blustery. Initially we didn't have high hopes for this mark
    because according to the description it's 12 feet lower than the road, and
    we figured it would be covered with brush.  We were right: there was plenty
    of dense brush, and no sign of an embedded rock, at least none that could be
    seen from the road.  We'll put this on our list to try again in early spring
    for the best chance of getting down into the woods. We walked up and down
    the road a few times, but we were also unable to find any sign of the
    masonry culvert that once held the reference mark, a chiseled square.  It,
    too, might be overgrown, or might even have been replaced.
