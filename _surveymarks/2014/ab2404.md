    This was another one of many benchmarks we found at the Flamingo marina
    today! It is set into one of the sidewalks surrounding the marina, directly
    north of the marina store. There is another building directly east of the
    mark that is now empty but apparently was once, according to the NGS
    description, a houseboat rental building. The disk is in good condition with
    legible stamping.
