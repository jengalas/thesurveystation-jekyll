    The coordinates put this mark very close to 36 JPN, which we did find.  I
    was looking forward to finding this one because all of the TT [x] J series
    we've found so far have been disks made of Aich's metal, a beautiful
    sparkling gold-colored alloy that resists tarnish. We spotted a few likely
    outcrops on Google Street View, but when we arrived on the site, I wasn't
    able to find the disk on any of those outcrops or anywhere else nearby.
    There isn't much to go on (the coordinates from the USGS datasheets are
    sketchy, often quite far off—in this case, they put the mark on the wrong
    side of the highway) and the utility poles now sport new numbers, so I'm not
    even certain we were looking in the correct spot.  Perhaps a late fall or
    winter day when the vegetation is down would allow for a more thorough
    search of the area. At that time we also might want to expand the search a
    distance up and down the highway. Also note that the highway in question is
    not, nor was it ever (according to PAHighways.com) State Highway 168. It is
    now State Route 435 and at the time this mark was set (1926) it was
    designated US Highway 611.
