    This is the second of two survey marks I found on the Route 92 bridge in
    Falls. It's near the southwestern end of the bridge, at a spot overlooking
    George Hock Memorial Park. The mark is set into the top of the northern
    bannister of the bridge. Next to it is a metal band stamped with the
    characters (possibly a highway station number?) 10186 SP2 57.
