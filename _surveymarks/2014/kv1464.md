    We parked on the street and Dad and I took a quick walk through a very busy
    part of town to search for the bench mark disk set vertically into the gate
    at the base of a long stone stairway leading uphill toward Lafayette
    College.  The disk is in excellent condition. A plaque in the opposite face
    of the gate explains that the stones came from Traill Green Observatory, a
    gift of Dr.  Traill Green. The observatory was razed in 1928.
