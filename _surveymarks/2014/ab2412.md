    There are two marks stamped M.L.W. 8.31 just a few feet apart, on the
    section of seawall southeast of Flamingo Visitors Center. If you look
    closely, you'll see that one of them has a “1” stamped on the right-hand
    side of the disk. That one is NGS PID AB2411. The other one, without the
    “1”, is this one: AB2412. They are both in good condition and, just like the
    other marks on the corners of the seawall all around Flamingo and the
    marina, very easy to find. (Just don't mix up the PIDs!)
