    48 DSW was an unplanned find.  The next mark on our list after TT 9 J was TT 8 J, along Tannery Road.  We were interested to see if Middle Creek Road truly does connect all the way through to Tannery Road; our Garmin nüvi was showing that it does and routing us that way, while Google Maps shows a gap of approximately ¾ mile.  (It turns out Google Maps is wrong. Middle Creek Road does connect through to Mill Brook Road and then Tannery Road.)  
    
    
    Rich suggested that I check the bridges along the way, and I was thrilled to find 48 DSW on the northeast wingwall of this bridge!  I was not thrilled, however, at the copious amount of poison ivy thickly surrounding the bridge on both sides.  I didn't even attempt to get close to the mark, which had a poison ivy leaf hanging over it; I simply photographed it from above. The disk is in good condition and the description is accurate, except that Middle Creek Road is now paved.
