    Recovered in good condition. The disk is worn but the stamping is still
    legible.  The Harrison Avenue bridge is being replaced, and the abutment
    holding the mark may be removed. This mark is in danger of being disturbed
    or destroyed.

    Rich and I stopped by this morning after a walk at Lake Scranton. I've been waiting a few weeks for the parked train that had been obscuring the mark to move. It finally did! We parked near the University tennis courts to access the mark just a short walk away. The disk is in good condition and somehow has avoided being covered by the graffiti that “decorates” the rest of this abutment's southern face.


    Next year a new bridge will be built adjacent to this one, and the old bridge (possibly including the abutments as well) will be torn down. We will be able to update the database again if that occurs.
