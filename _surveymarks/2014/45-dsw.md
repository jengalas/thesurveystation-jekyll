    Here's another mark to try again in winter. We drove to the intersection of Tisdel and Old Gravity Roads after our hike nearby at the Varden Conservation Area's Mid Valley tract. The description was straightforward enough, but the road shoulders were so overgrown that we were unable to see any monument or disk, and because this area is rife with poison ivy, we weren't about to start digging through the weedy growth.
    
    
    Just as we were about to leave, Dad said “Hey, look at this!” and pointed to an orange witness post among the weeds. It was so thickly covered that we hadn't noticed it even from a few feet away. This makes us even more confident that the mark is here and may even have been in recent use. But we'll have to check it out in a different season, when the weeds are down.
