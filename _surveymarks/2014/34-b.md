    We made a half-hearted attempt at this mark, to be honest. We were cold and
    getting hungry, and we had two more on our list for the day. Our research
    had indicated no visible concrete retaining wall in the vicinity, and we
    didn't see anything obvious when driving by. On a nicer day, I would like to
    search more thoroughly just in case there is some remaining sign of the
    wall, or if by chance one of the residents might know something about it.
