    I thought this would be a straightforward find, especially when I saw a USGS
    disk on the northwest abutment of the bridge as we drove by. But the disk
    currently set on the bridge is not stamped 24 ETL; it's in fact stamped only
    “RESET 1950.” I assume that it is a reset of 24 ETL, but I can't be certain.
    I'll mark 24 ETL as Not Found, probably replaced by “RESET 1950.”
