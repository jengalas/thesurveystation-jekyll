    Continuing our stroll eastward along Old Seven Mile Bridge, Rich spotted U
    278, the next mark in the line after V 278.  This disk is also in very good
    condition and is set in the north curb of the bridge.  The two mile walk
    from Pigeon Key back to Knights Key offers plenty of time to reflect on the
    engineering marvel of the bridge, and the fact that this extremely narrow
    span once carried a two-lane highway!
