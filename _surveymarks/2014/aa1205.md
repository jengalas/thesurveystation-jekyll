    We spotted the lighthouse on our benchmark tour of Key West this morning.
    (Of course, you can't miss it.) The current lighthouse opened in 1848 and
    was in active use for over 120 years, seeing several upgrades as technology
    progressed. It was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 1969. Today it
    houses a museum and for a small fee, the public can climb the 88 steps to
    the top for a view over the town and the ocean. We did not go inside today,
    but we would definitely consider it for a future visit.
