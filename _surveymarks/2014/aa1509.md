    We certainly didn't have any hopes of finding this stationâ€”it was last seen
    in 1937 and has been presumed destroyed or covered under fill since 1954.
    But we still put it on our list to investigate the area and look for any
    remaining reference marks. When we arrived at Bahia Honda State Park this
    morning we headed first toward the old railroad bridge, the eastern end of
    which is now a viewing platform over the ocean. As expected, we did not find
    the station disk or RM 1 (which was also not recovered since before 1954).
    But we were able to find RM 2 on the south wingwall of the bridge. It is in
    good condition and was easy to access.
