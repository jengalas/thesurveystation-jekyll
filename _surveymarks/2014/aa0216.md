    Recovered in good condition. Stamping is worn but legible. The mark is at
    the northern end of Bryant Avenue/Key Deer Boulevard, an entryway into the
    National Key Deer Refuge. The drainage ditches are overgrown but still
    evident.

    The first mark we had in mind for our morning at the Key Deer Refuge was
    supposed to be in/near a “mosquito drainage ditch” which in its current
    overgrown state is even less impressive than it sounds. But actually, it's
    quite cool how these channels were carved into the rock. This network of
    ditches drains the mosquito habitat in an attempt to control the population
    by providing channels to freely introduce fish, which feed on the insect
    larvae, to the area. We had quite a time getting to this mark in the
    overgrowth, and maneuvering in order to take a decent photo was also
    challenging. It took a few tries going back out to the road and looking for
    a likely spot before we zeroed in on the mark. The disk is in good condition
    and solidly set, although it is worn or corroded, making the stamping
    somewhat difficult to discern.
