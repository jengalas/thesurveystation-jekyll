    TT 13 T was next on our list after our success at nearby Keen Lake. As we drove by the coordinates I had estimated from the topo map, all we could see was swamp—in fact, deep standing water, and no sign of a large rock outcrop. The description was vague, too.  The situation required in-person investigation.  


    Rich parked at the intersection of T 435 (Layton Road) and Tuthill Road.  As soon as I walked a few yards northeast along Tuthill Road, I could see a large rock outcrop east of the road, just inside the tree line.  Unwilling to wade through the weeds, which most certainly contained poison ivy (of course), I scouted the rock outcrop with the help of binoculars. I still couldn't see a disk, but with no other outcrops anywhere nearby, I was sure this was the correct one.  I took a chance and picked my way delicately through the weedy border (which did contain a small amount of P.I., but a much larger quantity of dewberry). I was soon standing right over the mark.  It was well camouflaged, but easily spotted from just a few feet away.


    The disk is in excellent condition and is solid in its setting in the outcrop. It is easily accessible so is probably a good choice for surveyors to use.  We didn't, however, see any indications of recent use like nearby flagging tape or paint.
