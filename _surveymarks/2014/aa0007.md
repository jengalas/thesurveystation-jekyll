    Much of our plan for the day's activities was built around various benchmark
    locations. The first was a benchmark disk—872 4580 TIDAL 30—set vertically
    into the brick wall of the old courthouse. It was an easy find once we
    located the correct building, and required a quick dive into the shrubbery
    to recover it. At the time of our visit, the disk was encircled with red
    paint. The disk is in good condition.
