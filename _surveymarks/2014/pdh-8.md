    I knew there was a reason that we always check each corner of a bridge for
    marks! For some reason, there are actually two marks on this bridge: [RESET 1950](/surveymarks/reset-1950/) (possibly a reset of [24 ETL](/surveymarks/24-etl/)) and this PDH mark. Like many similar PDH marks, this one is in good condition and is unstamped.
