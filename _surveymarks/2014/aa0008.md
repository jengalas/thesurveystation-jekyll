    We had planned to spend the morning getting oriented in Key West, and our
    first stop was the courthouse, which of course is a landmark station. We
    were not expecting to see this distinctive monument in the courthouse lawn!
    The monument projects over two feel above the level of the surrounding lawn.
    A standard bench mark disk is set in the top of the monument; the disk is in
    reasonably good condition for being so exposed. Inscribed on the northeast
    face of the monument are the words UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY
    BASIC BENCH MARK.
