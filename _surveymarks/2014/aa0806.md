    We spent our morning getting acquainted with Islamorada. We searched for a
    few benchmarks in Founders' Park, walked some sections of the Heritage
    Trail, and drove up and down the highway, checking out the sights and
    stopping here and there to check the bridges for benchmarks. This was one of
    them. This mark is set on a curb of the old bridge over Channel #2. It is in
    good condition. The old bridge is the more northerly of the two and is now
    used for hiking, biking, and fishing.
