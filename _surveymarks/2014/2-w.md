    2 W was the first mark we had planned to look for on our way to Salt Springs
    State Park. The description specifies only that the mark is west of the
    stream, although the topo map shows the mark near the northwest corner of
    the bridge. The situation looked promising when we arrived—the rusty
    guardrail seemed to indicate that the bridge was untouched for decades.
    Unfortunately for us, it looks like the bridge deck was repaired and new
    concrete was poured over the existing foundations, including the guardrail
    post bases. The date “2011” is scratched into the concrete at the southwest
    corner of the bridge.  We checked all corners and both sides of the bridge,
    but found no sign of the disk.
