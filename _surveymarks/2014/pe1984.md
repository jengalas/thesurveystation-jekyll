    Our survey mark hunts have introduced us to many new and fascinating places, and many kind and interesting people (and some not-so-kind people, but we try to forget about those encounters). LITTLE DEER ISLE RESET was a positive experience all around!


    When we realized we'd be spending a day in Blue Hill, we naturally searched the maps and datasheets for interesting survey marks in the area. A log on the Geocaching.com page for LITTLE DEER ISLE RESET indicates that the owner of the property containing the station is aware of the marks and participates in their stewardship. Cool! This made a trip to Little Deer Isle all the more intriguing for us, and we added it to our list of activities for today.


    After a hike at Blue Hill Mountain and several other benchmark recoveries in the area, we crossed the bridge to Little Deer Isle and drove up winding Mourning Dove Lane to its end at a two-story cottage. A man, presumably the property owner, was standing off to the side of the yard, shovel in hand! He looked friendly and waved as we approached. What luck!
