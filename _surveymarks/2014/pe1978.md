    We usually prefer searching for tri-stations deep in the woods over those next to the road, but BILLINGS RESET has the advantage of being located on the route we were taking between Little Deer Isle and Blue Hill (along Caterpillar Hill Road—as far as road names go, one of my favorites!). Speaking of great names, this tri-station is less than a mile away from El El Frijoles, which has the best fresh, locally sourced Mexican food you'll find in Maine, guaranteed.


    We found convenient parking on the east shoulder of Caterpillar Hill Road, although it's also possible to park in a small clearing next to the “Welcome to Sargentville” sign.  As we could tell immediately upon crossing the road, this is no longer a blueberry field. Instead it's filled with black-eyed susans, Queen Anne's lace (wild carrot) and other summer wildflowers that were past their prime when we visited, but probably make a bright and beautiful scene in July. It was a short, scratchy walk through the dry brush to the station mark, which we found easily on a small outcrop. Due to the height of the weeds and flower stalks, we couldn't see either reference mark from the station. We used the distances given in the box score to put us in the general area; it took only a minute before Rich found one reference mark and dad found the other.


    All three marks are in good condition in small rock outcrops, as described.
