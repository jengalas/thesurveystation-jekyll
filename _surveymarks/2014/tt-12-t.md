    Cool—another mark at (well, near) a monastery! We were in the area today looking for several other USGS TT marks, so this was on our list.


    We knocked on the door of one of the houses near the coordinates. A frazzled-looking woman answered; fortunately she was friendlier than she looked. She spoke with a strong New York accent, which led me to think she hadn't lived here very long. She didn't know anything about the Hetzel family mentioned in the description. She also knew nothing about the mark.


    The large building at the driveway entrance (perhaps the old farmhouse?) apparently belongs to the monastery. The woman was reluctant to allow us to search because, according to her, most of the grounds, even on this side of the road, belong to the monastery as well.  She advised us to try to contact the monks for permission. (If [our experience at GREEN](/surveymarks/ly2755/) is any indication of how well monks and nuns take to survey mark hunting on their property, I'm going to say that it won't be worth the trouble.)


    There is a small slope covered by vegetation in the approximate location of the coordinates. We looked at this area from the driveway, but we couldn't see anything obvious. We may have to attempt to get permission, or at least take a closer look in a less weedy season.
