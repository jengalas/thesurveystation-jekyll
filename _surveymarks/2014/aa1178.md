    Although we didn't “find” this mark (it's not really clear what it even
    was—could the steel pedestal be seen from a distance?) it was still a very
    exciting adventure. The West Martello Fort is now home to lush botanical
    gardens growing up, in and around the ruins of the old fort. We followed the
    coordinates to the remnants of this old brick tower. Only one level is
    evident and the ceiling is cemented in, so we can't really say what might
    have been on the higher level. What we found really cool was the imprint of
    the edge of a spiral staircase embedded in the concrete lining the tower.
