    The station, both reference marks, and the azimuth mark were recovered in good condition as described. The station is located at the trailhead for the Long Pine Key Trail in Everglades National Park. Witness posts are still in place at the sites of the station and the azimuth mark. 


    Nail impressions on the concrete station monument are several degrees off from the actual bearings to the reference marks. Add approximately 5 degrees clockwise to the directions indicated by the nail impressions to find the correct bearings.


    Handheld GPS coordinates for RM 1 are 25 25 38.5(N) 080 43 14.2(W).


    Handheld GPS coordinates for RM 2 are 25 25 37.3(N) 080 43 14.6(W).


    Handheld GPS coordinates for the azimuth mark are 25 25 52.9(N) 080 43 10.3(W).

    Our first full day in the Everglades began with guava pastries and some
    benchmark hunting. After finding one of the many rod-in-sleeve marks along
    the Main Park Road, we turned and headed south along the access road to the
    Long Pine Key Trail. This tri-station is right near the trailhead, buried in
    some sawgrass (so use caution when recovering!). We found a witness post at
    the site of the station and also the azimuth mark. Also interesting were the
    nail impressions set into the monument. We've found these a few times in the
    past, and typically they point toward the reference marks. For some reason,
    in this case, they each were about 5 degrees off from the correct bearing.
    The azimuth mark was an easy find just like the station, about .25 north of
    the station along the access road to the trailhead. It is also in fine
    condition.
