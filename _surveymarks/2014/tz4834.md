    Of the three disks we found at Fort Jefferson today, this was the only one
    we knew about in advance (because it's in the NGS database). It was so
    exciting to climb to the top of the fort, but what made it even better was
    searching for and finding this benchmark on top of the rampart! There are
    beautiful views in every direction, including toward the Loggerhead Key
    lighthouse toward the west (which is a landmark station). This disk is in
    very good condition, and it's also in an excellent picnic spot! While we
    rested in the sunshine near this mark, we watched a lizard making his way
    along some of the prickly pear cactus pads that are growing on top of the
    fort. We suspect that seeds were dropped here by migrating birds and
    eventually germinated.
