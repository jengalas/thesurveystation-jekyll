    On our way back from a hike at Varden Conservation Area (Mid Valley tract),
    we stopped to check out a few bridges along Mid Valley Road. On the east
    wingwall on the south side of this small bridge over Middle Creek we found
    this PennDOT survey control mark. It is in very good condition and is
    recessed into a hole that's larger than it needed to be (and some small
    pieces of gravel had worked their way into the gap).  It was a strange
    setting that we've never seen before. There was also a mistake in the
    initial stamping that was crossed out and restamped correctly and legibly
    above. It appears that the “3” was initially stamped backwards.
