    Recovered in good condition. The mark is set in the curb at the far western
    edge of the pier. The light poles have changed since the original
    description was written. The disk is northwest of the third light pole,
    counting from the north end of the pier.

    This was another relatively easy find on the White Street Pier. We were a
    little misled at first by the Power Squadron recovery note from 2003; it
    seems that they may have mixed this one up with 872 4557 TIDAL 4, which does
    appear to be missing. (At least we couldn't find it, and neither could a
    geocacher a few years ago.) But this one is easy to find once you realize
    that the light poles must have changed since the original description was
    written. The disk is northwest of the third light pole (rather than the
    first), counting from the north end of the pier.
