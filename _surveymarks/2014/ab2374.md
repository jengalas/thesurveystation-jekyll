    On our way into the park this morning, we stopped to look for one of many
    benchmarks along the Main Park Road. We thought this would be an interesting
    one because it's a rod inside an access hatch (somewhat unusual in our
    experience) and is located directly across the road we were going to take to
    access a nearby tri-station, KARR. The rod and hatch appear to be in good
    condition. There's an entire series of these 432 marks along this road that
    we would eventually like to search for!
