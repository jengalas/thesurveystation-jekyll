    Our second find as we poked around Easton this early afternoon was a
    chiseled double “X” in the foundation of the old county jail. It was carved
    as a bench mark in 1881 and marked nearby with the letters USBM, also
    carved, as identification. This is one of the oldest and most interesting
    marks we've found to date! I'm going to say it's in good condition because
    the US BM carving is still deep and clear, although the double-X is faint.
    The mark is easy to access and doesn't appear to be in danger of damage or
    obstruction.
