    This find is courtesy of the BenchMap app (thank you, Mike/TSQMadness!). Rich, Dad and I were on our way to the Mariton Wildlife Sanctuary for a morning of hiking before the Banff Mountain Film Festival in the evening.  While Rich drove along Route 611 (a terrifyingly narrow but breathtaking beautiful lane alongside the Delaware River), I checked BenchMap to see what marks might be nearby.  We were coming right up on V 268! It was worth a look.  
    
    
    Rich parked on Raubsville Rd., directly across Route 611 from Canal Road, where we expected to find the mark.  Dad and I crossed the highway and walked right up to the mark on the bridge over the old Delaware Canal.  The disk is in very good condition with easily legible stamping.  While I took photos, Dad wandered around to check out the canal towpath and the historic buildings in the area.
