    We found this disk easily while on our benchmark hunt along the White Street
    Pier. The original NGS description refers to light poles, which have changed
    since 1982, when that description was written. The disk is now northeast of
    the fifth light pole from the north end of the pier. The disk shows some
    corrosion, but the designation and date are still easily legible.
