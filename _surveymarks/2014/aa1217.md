    The Key West courthouse along Whitehead Street was our first stop of the
    day.  I had planned on two benchmarks at this spot, but when we arrived we
    found there was actually a third ([872 4580 TIDAL
    BASIC](/surveymarks/aa0008/)) that I wasn't aware of.  That's always an awesome surprise!  The
    courthouse itself is a typical cupola-topped building pretty much like you
    would find anywhere in the U.S., but it's surrounded by palms and a kapok
    tree, and of course the festive atmosphere of Key West.
