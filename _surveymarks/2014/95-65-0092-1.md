    There may not be any NGS marks on the Falls bridge, but there <em>are</em>
    two PennDOT marks!  As usual, we didn't know about them in advance, but we
    knew it was worth a look. I found this disk at the northeastern end of the
    bridge, set into the end of the north bannister. The bridge was replaced in
    1995-1996, so it makes sense that this relatively new PennDOT survey disk
    was set at that time. It is still in very good condition.
