    After our hike at Blue Hill Mountain and on our way to El El Frijoles for lunch, we passed this church and decided to stop and take a few photos. It wasn't a high priority mark, but we were passing right by. The church spire appears to be in very good condition. This is still the Blue Hill Congregational Church and, according to a sign next to the doors, was built in 1843. So I'm quite sure this is the same spire that was first observed in 1863.
    
    
    My father was confused about why I was taking photos of a church. Once we explained that it was a landmark station, it made more sense to himâ€”or at least I think it did.
