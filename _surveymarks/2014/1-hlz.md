    We're in this area at least once a year for our friend Dave's annual 4th of July picnic at Lake Spangenberg. For various reasons (usually because the weather is miserable!) we haven't used the opportunity to search for benchmarks in the area. This year, I decided to change that, and we selected two marks that looked like they would be simple and quick finds.
    
    
    It was easy enough to find 1 HLZ and read the designation, but there's no way I was about to move the poison ivy covering the mark to get a better photo. The disk appears to be in good condition and is set as described, in the northwest wingwall of a small bridge along Cortez Road (S.R. 3018).
