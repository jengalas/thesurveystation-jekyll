    Little Deer Isle resident Peter Bell, whom we had met at LITTLE DEER ISLE
    RESET, gave us a tip on viewing the lighthouse. According to him it's easy
    to see the Pumpkin Island Lighthouse from several places on the northwestern
    end of Little Deer Isle, as we had hoped. What we weren't expecting was the
    stunning view of the lighthouse from Eggemoggin Road.  There is even a
    pull-off for easy parking and an outcropping ledge that serves as the
    perfect platform for photography. The structure including the tower appears
    to be in excellent condition. The lighthouse was built in 1854 and operated
    until 1933, when it was taken out of service as an active aid to navigation.
    It is currently a private residence.
