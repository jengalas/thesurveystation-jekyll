    When we were researching this mark, it looked like it would be a simple
    find.  We could see a nice flat outcrop on the Street View.  When we arrived
    at the site, we had the same impression.  In fact, the outcrop was even
    larger (and flatter) than we had expected, and it looked like absolutely the
    perfect spot for a bench mark disk.  All of the references in the
    description matched up.  But no disk was to be found!  I checked the outcrop
    as thoroughly as possible (part of it is covered with dried-out moss, which
    was difficult to remove, but I checked under it as well as I could).  I also
    noticed that the outcrop has one section that may have been broken off at
    some point (a **long** time ago), so it's possible the mark was on that
    section, but not likely because it was close to one edge of the outcrop.
    It's certainly possible that we didn't even find the correct outcrop, but we
    could see nothing else in the area that looked like a possibility.  So for
    now, this one remains a mystery.
