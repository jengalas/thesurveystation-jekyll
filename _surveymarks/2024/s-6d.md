  After a hike on Beech Mountain that included an old road and the Valley Trail, we were hiking back to the car along Lurvey Spring Road when we came across two Acadia boundary markers just meters apart from one another. S 6D was the second one we found; S 7 is just west of this marker. They are both in good condition.
