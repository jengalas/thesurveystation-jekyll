  After my first find of the day, the rivet along the rail trail just east of Lehr Lane, I turned around and headed west on the rail trail. The trail was peaceful and quiet, and I saw several pileated woodpeckers along the half-mile hike toward the site of B 46. I did not, however, find the benchmark. 
  
  
  Similar to the HUBER series of marks in Swatara State Park, this one was in a densely overgrown area, and the recovery notes from the datasheet gave me very little to go on. I do think, however, that with a measuring tape and a digging tool (and possibly a metal detector), I would have been able to locate this mark. A recovery note from 2006 described `THREE POLES BLOCKING VEHICLES FROM THE RAILBED` and gives distance and direction from one of the poles. While the poles certainly weren't obvious among all the vegetation, I was eventually able to find them. With the proper tools I probably could have used this data to pinpoint the mark. But as it was, my pacing-off of the distance and digging around in the brush and soil with my foot wasn't helping much.


  I suspect this mark is still in place, and it will just take some work to uncover it. If I do, I plan to place some kind of witness post here so it can be more easily found in the future.
