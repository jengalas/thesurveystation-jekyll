  On today's early morning walk around town, I decided to head north on the Strip. I headed from Bellagio over the Flamingo Road Overpass toward Caesar's Palace, and then down the escalator and out toward the boulevard. 005Y was the first marker I came across. It is set in the sidewalk just inside an ornate stone fence, near the fountain featuring two statues of mythological horses. The disk is in very good condition, but doesn't indicate its date of monumentation.
