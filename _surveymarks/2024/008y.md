  It was growing darker by the minute and everything on the Las Vegas Strip was bathed in a sickly pink glow. There was still enough light to spot one more Las Vegas Strip benchmark! Jean and I spotted this one tucked neatly in between some grooves forming a square in the sidewalk outside Caesar's Palace, on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard. It is in good condition, and there is a reference mark for this disk somewhere nearby that I will search for another day.
