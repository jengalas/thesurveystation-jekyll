    This was the second mark I attempted to locate on this cool, cloudy Death Hike day. After an early success at [58 CH](/surveymarks/58-ch/) nearby, I had high hopes for this one, but I had no luck here. There is no sign of a rock outcrop in the church yard; the yard is level and fully covered with grass. There were a few rocks poking out from beneath the grass that I suppose _could_ have been part of a subsurface outcrop, but even if so, there would be no way to recover this mark without digging up the lawn.
