  Finally! After many strikeouts this morning, I finally found a survey marker! Although this one isn't a disk, and is merely a rivet set in a stone culvert along the old railroad, at least it was something, and it's in the NGS database so I can contribute an update.


  I drove as far south as possible on the unmarked Lehr Lane, and parked the car at the edge of a washed-out creek where a sawhorse (and, of course, the giant hole beyond) blocked the way. There wasn't much farther to go anyway: just a few more yards walking south and I was on the old railbed, now part of the Swatara Rail Trail. I turned left (east) and had just a few more yards to walk until I reached the stone culvert where I expected (hoped!) to find the rivet.


  And, of course, the top of the culvert was covered with soil and huge thorns, as I'd seen everywhere else on my travels today. But this time I had a photo from the NGS database to help out. I was able to match up the shape of the rocky edge of the culvert to determine what area to clear off, and ... finally! There was the rivet! What a feeling of satisfaction. It is in good condition, as far as I can tell, as is the culvert it's set into.
