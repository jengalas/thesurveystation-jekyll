  After finding 103Y and 104Y, I wasn't surprised to come across 105Y just a short distance down the sidewalk.  This marker is in excellent condition, like the others nearby, and is set in the sidewalk in front of Outback Steakhouse. It is directly across the Boulevard from the Mirage Casino complex.
