  We had some time to kill this morning, and Belfast seemed like the perfect place to explore. We were initially drawn to the area by the pedestrian bridge surrounding the river, which we spotted from Youngâ€™s Lobster Pound across the way. But first, we thought we would search for a series of tidal benchmarks that I spotted on the NGS map.


  The first marker on our list was TIDAL 2, and we noticed it immediately because it is bright blue and set vertically in a high ledge, facing right out toward the beach. I moved on to recover another mark in this series, TIDAL 7 set in the adjacent ledge, before documenting this mark. TIDAL 2 is quite worn and the stamping is hard to read, but still legible. "NO. 2" stands out easily. It is in good to fair condition and it is in a very solid, stable setting.
