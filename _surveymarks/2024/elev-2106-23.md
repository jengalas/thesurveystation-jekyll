  Only in Vegas! What appeared at first to be a typical recovery of a small survey marker turned out to be quite amusing later on when I viewed the photo and noticed the "decoration" next to it on the sidewalk. This is another local surveyor's mark and it is set in the curb of the sidewalk along the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard. It is just east of a parking lot in front of Caesar's Palace.
