    This was third mark I attempted to locate before today's hike at Ricketts Glen State Park. I was hoping for better luck here than at my last attempt a few miles away, but it wasn't to be. The fire roads crisscrossing this area do not seem to have been altered in any way, at least based on their appearance on old maps and aerial photos, but I found no sign of the mark, nor even a boulder that seemed a likely candidate. There are a few small boulders in this area that are covered with forest debris and moss, so it's possible the mark is set in one of them, but in order to locate it I would need much more time than I had today, and probably a metal detector as well.
