  There are just so many of these benchmark disks along this stretch of the Strip that it's very easy to bypass one here and there.  I suspect that this mark is still in place, but that I just didn't notice it, having been distracted by the Mirage waterfalls and volcano. In any case, I did find a reference mark that "belongs" to both 20Y and 21Y (according to its designation), so I'm listing this mark anyway for completeness. For more information on 020Y, see its listing on waymarking.com: [Las Vegas Strip Right of Way Benchmark #020 Y](https://waymarking.com/waymarks/wm7EC5_Las_Vegas_Strip_Right_of_Way_Benchmark_020_Y).
