  It was time to turn around and head back for breakfast, so I decided to cross over the Boulevard on the footbridge and head south on the east side of the road. It didn't take long before I found yet another survey marker. This one is in excellent condition and is set in the sidewalk in front of William Hill Sports Book - Casino Royale. It is directly across the Boulevard from the Mirage Casino complex.
