  This was the first of the Las Vegas Strip benchmarks I found on my quick business trip to Sin City. After a pleasant and relatively quiet dinner at Jasmine, a Chinese restaurant in Bellagio, my colleague Jean and I took a walk outside to check out the famous fountains. After watching the show, we continued north (I admit, I already knew there were some benchmarks to find in this area!). I was not expecting this one to be quite so close to the road-although it turned out that many of them in this area are set similarly-but I spotted it quickly after a short look around. It also may have helped that the mark was flanked by two orange traffic cones that drew my attention. The mark is in relatively good condition with the designation still legible.

  The mark is set into the west curb of Las Vegas Boulevard, near the northern end of the Bellagio fountains and about 100 feet south of the pedestrian overpass connecting the Bellagio shopping mall and Ole Red Las Vegas.
