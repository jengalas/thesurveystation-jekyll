  I figured I had better turn around at this point, since I only had a couple hours this morning to explore, so I began heading north again along the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard. I passed the Denny's where I had found two markers earlier, and I found a few more markers set outside the parking garage at the FlyOver ride. 18X is another shiny, relatively new marker set in the middle of the driveway into the parking garage.
