  This was the second Las Vegas Strip benchmark found while on an after-dinner walk with my colleague. In fact, she was the one who found this mark! She was somewhat excited to search for it after seeing nearby 058X and knowing now what to look for. The mark is in good condition and is set in the curb on the streetside of a fence/bannister in front of Bellagio.
