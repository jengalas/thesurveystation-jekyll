  After locating bench mark '102' at the courthouse building, we moved on to the next mark in town, which is at the post office just up one block and across the street. This mark, S 18, we both commented, was quite a handsome mark. It was perfectly neatly stamped and evenly shiny. It's a very easy mark to find as it's set vertically in the northeast-facing brick wall of the post office, right next to the main entrance.
