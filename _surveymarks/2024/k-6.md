  > MaineDOT description:  To reach the station from Trenton, go 4.0 km (2.5 mi)
  Southeast along a concrete road; thence, 2.4 km (1.5 mi) Southwest along the
  road the Indian point to a 3-way intersection and the station. The station
  mark is a standard tablet, stamped...K 6 1934..., set in the top of a large
  ledge. It is: 42.7 m (140 ft) West of the Northwest most Road junction (at a
  3-way intersection) 14.6 m (48 ft) North of the centerline of the road 23.5 m
  (77 ft) Northeast of transformer pole \# 72 0.3 m (1 ft) South of a small rock
  carin 0.6 m (2 ft) West of the extreme East face


  On our way to Blagden Preserve, we stopped at the nearby intersection of Oak
  Hill Road and Indian Point Road to look for K 6, a USGS benchmark that somehow
  we've never searched for in the past.


  The coordinates I had seemed way off and took me a few hundred feet off the
  road into a wooded area with no ledges, so I rescaled them from the topo map
  and tried again. This attempt at least brought me to a nice ledge about the
  correct distance from the road, which was a good start, but the ledge was
  completely covered with moss, dead/dried leaves, dead branches, and rotten
  trees. I didn't even know where to begin to clear off the ledge to look for
  the mark. I did roll up some of the moss layers to look underneath, and I
  moved a few of the more reasonably sized branches to no avail.


  Meanwhile Rich was reading through the datasheet and looking around for any
  useful references, such as nearby transformer pole \#72. He suggested I try
  clearing off a few other parts of the ledge, unfortunately also to no avail.


  The whole time I kept thinking about how I really needed to have some tools
  with me (a trowel and a metal detector would be great!) and how I felt very
  exposed wandering around and scraping off rocks on someone else's property
  with homes nearby and people constantly driving by on the road (which, of
  course, turned from a quiet road on which we saw no other cars into an
  Interstate highway the minute I stepped into the woods).


  At least the property isn't posted, and I found out later that it is owned by
  some property management company from New Jersey. So I doubt the neighbors
  would care all that much if someone was poking around in there. But we'll see.
  We certainly may try again! I would love to find it.
