    There is a listing on waymarking.com for 007Y (see [Las Vegas Strip Right of Way Benchmark #007 Y](https://waymarking.com/waymarks/wm7EBQ_Las_Vegas_Strip_Right_of_Way_Benchmark_007_Y)), and although many of the Las Vegas Strip benchmarks listed there have since been destroyed due to construction, I don't think that would be the case for this one. However, I simply didn't spot it for some reason. An associated reference mark is nearby, and it appears to be in good condition.
