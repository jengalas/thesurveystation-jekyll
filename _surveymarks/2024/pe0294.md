  Our third find along today's Route 102 benchmark run was A 145, and it was the easiest find of the day. We pulled off the road right before the mailbox for #180, and I could see the boulder (and the disk on top of it) all the way from the road. I was a little concerned because it was so close to the house, but there were no vehicles in the driveway and the house was dark, although I spotted a few open windows. I was able to photograph the mark without incident. It is in very good condition and is likely in a stable setting for years to come.
