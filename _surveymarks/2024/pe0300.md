  Recovered in good condition. To reach from the US Coast Guard base (Southwest Harbor Sector Field Office) at the south end of Clark Point Road, take the driveway marked 8 Crows Nest on the east side of the fence about 200 ft (61.0 m) southerly along the east side of the Coast Guard buildings to the house at the south end.  Obtain permission to enter the property and beach south of the house, and proceed south and east around the house to the end of the fence and concrete retaining wall.  Descend to the beach. The mark is set in the top of a prominent outcropping ledge, about 15 feet southeast of TIDAL 6 STA 12 (PE0299). The mark is difficult to spot as it mimics the color, texture, and shape of lichen covering the rock outcrop.

  This was such an interesting mark! It was fun to find something obviously old (and to actually know what it was) and to find one that surveyor JRO didn't find. I will admit, it took me a few minutes. Given the description, it wasn't exactly clear what I was searching for or what it would look like. But the only likely location was the large ledge southeast of TIDAL 6, where JRO suspected that TIDAL 2 would be set. He was correct about that. There is so much gray and white lichen on this outcrop that the white-oxidized lead slug blends in and hides quite easily. It took me two passes over the outcrop to notice it, and even then, I wasn't sure until I got down close to the mark and noticed the "X" cut in the center and the punch mark that I was sure I'd found a survey mark.
  
  
  The mark is set on the top of the prominent rock outcrop, approximately 15 feet southeast of TIDAL 6. It is, as described, lead poured into a drill hole, with a punch mark and an "X" cut into the middle of it.
