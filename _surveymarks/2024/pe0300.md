  This was such an interesting mark! It was fun to find something obviously old (and to actually know what it was) and to find one that surveyor JRO didn't find. I will admit, it took me a few minutes. Given the description, it wasn't exactly clear what I was searching for or what it would look like. But the only likely location was the large ledge southeast of TIDAL 6, where JRO suspected that TIDAL 2 would be set. He was correct about that. There is so much gray and white lichen on this outcrop that the white-oxidized lead slug blends in and hides quite easily. It took me two passes over the outcrop to notice it, and even then, I wasn't sure until I got down close to the mark and noticed the "X" cut in the center and the punch mark that I was sure I'd found a survey mark.
  
  
  The mark is set on the top of the prominent rock outcrop, approximately 15 feet southeast of TIDAL 6. It is, as described, lead poured into a drill hole, with a punch mark and an "X" cut into the middle of it.
