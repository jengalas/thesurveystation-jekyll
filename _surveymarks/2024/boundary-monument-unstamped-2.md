    This boundary monument was a surprise find during our walk today on the old Wildwood Farm Road. We began at Wildwood Stables and hiked the old road from Stable Lane southwest, passing beneath the Park Loop Road, to its end at Jordan Pond Road. Near a washout along a creek that crosses the road, I happened to spot this granite boundary marker with an unstamped, unmarked disk set into it!
