  CP NO 113 is another small local surveyor's mark, similar to the nearby CP NO 112. Initially I couldn't read the stamping, but Rich eventually figured it out, and I'm certain that he's right. This [entry on Waymarking](https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/wmA6H7_CP_113_Las_Vegas_Blvd) from 2010, when the stamping was more legible, seems to confirm this. The marker is set near the south corner of a traffic island at South Siegfried and Roy Drive leading into the Mirage Casino complex.
