  It was getting dark quickly, but Jean and I were still able to spot this small survey marker set in a traffic island near one of the entrances to Caesar's Palace. The mark is about 65 feet southeast of a statue of Julius Caesar on a nearby traffic island. This is not one of the fancy "Las Vegas Strip" markers like the others we found this evening, but rather a smaller mark set by a local surveyor. It appears to be in good condition, and all of its stamping is still legible after nearly 20 yearsâ€”quite a feat in a place that receives so much foot traffic.
