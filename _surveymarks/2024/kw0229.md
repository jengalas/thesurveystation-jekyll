    I admit I had expected this to be a relatively easy, quick find, and not a very exciting one - just a typical mark set into a bridge wingwall. These are usually obvious finds, and not often in terribly scenic locations. But I like to recover and report on them mostly because I think they are some of the most useful marks for surveyors.
  

    Imagine my surprise when I walked over to the northwest wingwall of the bridge, and did not see the mark. Closer inspection showed that a blob of concrete has been poured over the spot where I expected to see the mark! It appears that the mark has been covered up by the concrete. I have no idea if this was intentional or not, but there is no apparent reason for the blob of concrete to be there. I tried to chip off some of the concrete just to see if I could glimpse an edge of the mark, but I wasn't able to make enough of a dent.


    Just to be sure, I checked the other three wingwalls, and I also verified the location by matching up the view with the photographs of the mark in the NGS database from 2015. I was definitely in the correct spot.
