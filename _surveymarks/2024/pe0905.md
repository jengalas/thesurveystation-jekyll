  After a successful recovery of two (well, really three) marks that are part of a tidal station along the riverbank, Rich and I headed back into town to explore a bit and look for two more benchmarks. The first one was '102', an old-style disk set in the stone water table of the old courthouse building. It is in excellent condition. 
  
  
  The original description from "Spirit Leveling in Maine, 1899-1915" is as follows:
