  Recovered in good condition on the water table of the former Waldo County Superior Court building. The building ceased to function as a courthouse in 2019 and city hall offices are moving into the building as of 2024.

  After a successful recovery of two (well, really three) marks that are part of a tidal station along the riverbank, Rich and I headed back into town to explore a bit and look for two more benchmarks. The first one was '102', an old-style disk set in the stone water table of the old courthouse building. It is in excellent condition.
