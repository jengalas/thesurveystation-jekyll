  Heading north again along the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard, I passed the Denny's where I had found two markers earlier, and I found a few more markers set outside the parking garage at the FlyOver ride. 19X is another shiny, relatively new marker set near the north edge of the driveway into the parking garage.
