  Continuing south now along the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard, I found another marker just south of the intersection with MGM Road. This one is a nice, shiny, relatively new 2019 reset, just a few inches south of the tactile paving surface. Currently there is an Outback Steakhouse at this corner.
