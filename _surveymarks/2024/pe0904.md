  Recovered in good condition atop a large rock outcropping. Mark is about 400
  ft SE of the S corner of the Belfast Boathouse (formerly the site of the Wyman
  Lumber Company), and about 290 ft SE of the SE corner of a timber retaining
  wall at the boathouse.  Mark can be accessed from the beach at low tide. It is
  also accessible from the private property to the south. Note - the former U.S.
  Highway 1 bridge over the Passagassawakeag River is now a pedestrian bridge.
  In 1963 a new highway bridge was built several hundred feet to the north of
  the former highway bridge.

  We had some time to kill this morning, and Belfast seemed like the perfect
  place to explore. We were initially drawn to the area by the pedestrian bridge
  surrounding the river, which we spotted from Young’s Lobster Pound across the
  way. But first, we thought we would search for a tidal benchmark station that
  I spotted on the NGS map.


  Often these tidal markers along the shore require crossing private property to
  gain access, but this one appeared to be on the property of, or at least
  adjacent to, a town boathouse. That looked promising! So we drove over to
  Belfast from the lobster pound, just a 5 minute drive at most, and navigated
  through the twisty and very busy streets of this old town toward the
  boathouse. The area along the shore here was indeed some combination of a town
  landing, boathouse, and small beach/park. We made our way over the coarse
  pebbly sand toward the “notable ledges” that supposedly held the series of
  tidal marks (two disks and one drill hole).


  This marker, TIDAL 7, was set on the “third notable ledge,” according to the
  description.  While we zeroed in on the ledge pretty easily, this mark was a
  bit tricky to spot. The ledge was high and wet, and surrounded at its base by
  very slippery wet seaweed. I carefully climbed up on the ledge and looked
  around for a full minute before spotting the disk, which was well camouflaged
  due to its discolored and eroded state, right in front of me. The stamping can
  still be read, and the mark is solid in a very stable setting, so I’m calling
  its condition Good.
