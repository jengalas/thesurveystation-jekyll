  On my late afternoon walk around town after a very filling lunch at El Sol nearby, I spotted this unusual elevation benchmark in the sidewalk near Market and 4th Streets. The small disk is set in a hexagonal post which is itself set into a round post. The mark is flush with the ground. The elevation is stamped into the mark, but there is no other identifying information, and I wasn't able to locate any data for the mark.
