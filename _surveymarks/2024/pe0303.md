  I really thought we were going to have an exciting find here! I noticed the "not found" recovery note from JRO from 2018, but I also checked the recent Street Views, and there I spotted something that looked exactly like a disk (round, brown, on a rock face in the right direction and location, and about the right distance above ground). Rich and I were both nearly convinced that was the benchmark, and we could hardly wait to check it out this morning.

  
  It was funny, even on the way over we made a few jokes about nice round lichen spots having fooled us in the past. Well, guess what happened this time. Yes, as soon as I got out of the car and crossed the road, I could see that the round spot was indeed a lichen spot. Damn.


  We searched the rock cut/outcrop (we're not convinced that it's a rock cut) as thoroughly as possible, but no mark was visible. We agree with JRO that the mark is very likely still here, but covered by moss or vegetation overgrowth. A metal detector would probably be very helpful. If we get a new metal detector, we may try again!
