  This is a guest recovery by my father Dave and his friend Lucy. After a period of rain, they were looking to get out for a walk, and Dad asked if there were any interesting benchmarks in the area. I suggested this one, R 1320, as a possibility. They walked over to Golden Gate Park on Christmas Eve and found the mark, and according to Lucy they really had fun looking for it. She said that she has walked by it thousands of times without knowing the mark was there. The mark appears to be in good condition. The monument is slightly eroded at its edges, but the mark is still solid in its setting.
