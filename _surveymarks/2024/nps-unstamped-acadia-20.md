  This is yet another unstamped Acadia National Park boundary marker we found along Old Norway Road! While the others were found along the paved, still-active northern section of the road, this one is set on the boundary just to the east of the abandoned portion of the road. Like the others, the pipe and disk are in good condition and are probably stable enough to indicate the boundary reasonably well.
