  Recovered in good condition. The 1960 description is adequate. The residence mentioned in the description is #521 Suedberg Road. The utility pole still displays the number 36116, in addition to 36525, S43985, and D 107A.

  I expected an easy find here, since I was able to see the monument and even the disk on top on Google Street View. I figured I would head to Swatara State Park first and recover this mark later in the day, but I did take a look as I drove by, and I saw it. At least that was going to be one mark in the bag! It gave me some hope throughout the rest of the morning, as most of my attempts came up empty.
