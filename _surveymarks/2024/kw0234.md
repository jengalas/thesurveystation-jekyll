  Recovered in good condition. The 1960 description is adequate. The residence mentioned in the description is #521 Suedberg Road. The utility pole still displays the number 36116, in addition to 36525, S43985, and D 107A.

  I expected an easy find here, since I was able to see the monument and even the disk on top on Google Street View. I figured I would head to Swatara State Park first and recover this mark later in the day, but I did take a look as I drove by, and I saw it. At least that was going to be one mark in the bag! It gave me some hope throughout the rest of the morning, as most of my attempts this morning came up empty.


  After finishing my searches at the park, I drove back to the site of this azimuth mark, parked in a nearby construction area, and made the recovery. Nearly all of the references in the original description from 1960 are still adequate to locate the mark. Even the pole number is the same (although some other numbers have been added to the pole in the meantime). 


  Note: I would not typically search for an azimuth mark without also looking for the associated triangulation station. However, in this case I didn't have much time left, and the station and the two reference marks were all reported "not found" by PennDOT in 2022. PennDOT didn't give any further details in their recovery notes, so maybe in the future when I have some more time, I will take a look, just in case. The station and reference marks appear to be accessible from a nearby truck stop.
