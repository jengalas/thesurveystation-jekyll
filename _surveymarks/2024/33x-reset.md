  Continuing south along Las Vegas Boulevard, I spotted three more survey marks set in close proximity near the CVS just north of Park MGM, on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard. This one is just a few yards north of 32X RESET and just northeast of the northeast entrance to the CVS. All marks are in good condition.
