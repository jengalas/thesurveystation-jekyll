    Rich and I nearly missed this mark altogether. After a day of hunting and
    hiking in the gamelands and finding the [Tanners'
    Condos](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCKZHY_tanners-condos) geocache, we looked through our USGS datasheets and found two
    nearby disks ([29
    M](/surveymarks/29-m/) and [30 M](/surveymarks/30-m/))
    that we planned to investigate. It was only by accident that I happened to
    notice this “U.E.” listed, and we realized the mark had to be
    located on the bridge over the falls, which we'd just crossed twice. True to
    the description, a chiseled square was found on the northeast corner of the
    west pier of the bridge. Yellow paint is still evident along the side (north
    face) of the stone with the chiseled mark; currently there is no paint on
    the mark itself.
