    Our final find for today was a challenge to photograph. I'd avoided it on
    previous excursions due to its proximity to rushing traffic and the fact
    that there's very little room to stand next to the bridge, atop the steep
    bank down to Blooming Grove Creek (not Egypt Creek). Today, Rich and I were
    ready. We parked at the Good Shepherd Church, walked to the bridge and
    hopped over the guard rail. Recovering the mark was easier than I'd
    expected, but I did need to hang onto a sign post while stretching my other
    arm in front of me to take a photo of the mark. This Pennsylvania Department
    of Highways vertical control station was found in good condition as
    described, with the exception of the discrepancy over the name of the creek.

    **Recovered in good condition.**


    This second order vertical control station is set in the top of the east wingwall for the south abutment of a concrete bridge on Rt. 402 crossing Blooming Grove Creek. The 1959 historical description leads reliably to the station. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 12.2 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible.
