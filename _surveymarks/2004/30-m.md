    A day of hunting, geocaching and benchmarking wouldn't be complete without
    getting lost at least once along the way! All the map data we had available
    told us that Killroe Road would be a straight shot through the woods from
    Route 670 to Tanners Falls. Well, it's not. The road is closed just
    northeast of the last house on Killroe Road, coming from Route 670. We first
    discovered this when trying to get to the [Tanners'
    Condos](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCKZHY_tanners-condos) geocache, but somehow forgot (or confused ourselves) when trying
    to navigate back through the falls area toward this mark. We ended up
    following Egypt Road northwest all the way out to Route 670 and then coming
    back in on Killroe Road to the Y-intersection and the mark. The stone wall
    and wire fence still exist, and like [29 M](/surveymarks/29-m/), trees
    surrounding the boulder were blazed, making for an easy find. This disk is
    in good condition. We did not search for the reference mark at this time.
