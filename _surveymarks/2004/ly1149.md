    We were happy to have an easy, straightforward recovery after our difficult
    search for LY1153 ([E 237](/surveymarks/ly1153/)). This mark was
    found just as described. It is in good condition with legible stamping.

    **Recovered in good condition.**


    This second order vertical control station was found as described. The 1959 to-reach directions are still viable. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 15.2 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible.
