  The station mark was found in good condition. The dim trail road and
  powerpole X 15 were not found, but the mark was measured to be approximately
  58 feet east of the centerline of Route 402. The station is east of a point
  between two powerpoles that are 353 feet apart along the west shoulder of
  the highway: this point is 171 feet south along the shoulder from powerpole
  PPL Co. 71943 N44506, and 182 feet north along the shoulder from powerpole
  PPL Co. 71941 N44471.

  Continuing to search for marks in the 235 series, we worked our way north on
  Route 402 to search for P 235. This was a relatively straightforward find,
  although several references on the datasheet needed to be corrected. We had
  plenty of measuring ahead of us! The “dim trail road” mentioned in the 1959
  note can no longer be discerned, so we measured a perpendicular distance
  from the road centerline to the mark. That distance was found to be about 58
  feet. We also were unable to find a powerpole marked “X 15” (indeed, there
  is no longer any pole where “X 15” is described to have been). We did find
  two marked poles on the western shoulder of Route 402, one north of the mark
  and one south, that could be used for rough measurements. We measured the
  distance between each pole and the point on the line between the poles
  directly west of the mark; measurements are given below. I was excited to
  find the letters “BM” painted on a tree just a few feet from the mark!

  **Recovered in good condition.**


  This second order vertical control station is set in the top of an outcropping boulder roughly 58 feet east of the centerline of Rt. 402, about level with the blacktop, and about 1 foot above ground level. In addition, it is east of a point between two powerpoles that are 353 feet apart along the west shoulder of the highway. This point is roughly 171 feet south along the shoulder from powerpole number: PP&L Co. 71943 N44506, and roughly 182 feet north along the shoulder from powerpole number: PP&L Co. 71941 N44471. The dim trail road referred to in the 1959 historical description could not be discerned. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 40.8 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible.
