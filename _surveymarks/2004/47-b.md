    After my successful search for the nearby disk [46 B](/surveymarks/46-b/), I drove
    directly to the Milwaukee United Methodist Church to see what might remain
    of this one. As I approached the church steps, my heart sank. The steps were
    covered with new gray outdoor carpeting. I assumed that the disk would still
    be in place underneath, but I wasn't about to tear up the carpet. Luckily, I
    didn't have to! A hole was cut in the carpeting to allow the disk to show
    through. It was encouraging to see that someone realized and respected the
    value of the mark, and went through some extra effort to ensure that it was
    accessible. The reference mark was not found; a bridge still exists at this
    location, but it is new.
