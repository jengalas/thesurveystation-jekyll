    Our main adventure for the morning was a scenic hike along beautiful
    Wallenpaupack Creek, during which we found the Little Falls Cache. On our
    way home, we decided to extend our morning's adventures by searching for a
    few benchmarks along Route 390. This mark was easy to locate using the
    historic description, which remains accurate. Our only additional
    observation was that the “blacktop road” forming the Y intersection with
    Route 390 is named Shiney Mt. Road, according to the sign at the
    intersection. Distances and directions to the reference objects matched
    those given in the 1959 description. The mark is in good condition.

    **Recovered in good condition.**


    This second order vertical control station was found as described. The historical direction is still viable. Shiney Mt. Road forms the Y-intersection with Rt. 390. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 68.5 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible.
