    This mark was our third and final find of the day. My father again assisted
    in the search, and we quickly spotted the mark set in the stone foundation
    at the southwest corner of the church. It is concealed by shrubbery and is
    set behind a flower bed, making it difficult to get a close-up photo. The
    disk is in good condition, and no changes to the original description are
    necessary.
