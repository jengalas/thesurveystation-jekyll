    I couldn't resist searching for a few local benchmarks this beautiful, sunny
    Tuesday morning. I was in Clarks Summit on other business anyway, and
    thought it would be nice to take a little trip out into the "country." I've
    been to the old high school in the past, and I've driven by the church many
    times, without any idea that benchmarks were so close by. The disk at the
    old school (now the Newton Recreation Center) is located on the top step of
    a set of concrete stairs leading down to a basement door on the southwest
    side of the school building. It has been painted over. Interestingly, the
    mark has likely been used since being painted over. I noticed that the layer
    of paint was, at some point, rubbed off the designation and date to make
    them more legible. I searched for the reference mark, a chiseled square
    described to be 122 feet south of the disk-which would place it
    approximately in the area of a newly-constructed concrete wheelchair ramp.
    If there was ever another basement entrance south of the mark, it is now
    gone. Just to be sure, I checked the other remaining basement entrance, just
    northwest of the set of stairs holding the disk, but found no evidence of a
    chiseled square on the concrete doorstep or anywhere else on the structure.
