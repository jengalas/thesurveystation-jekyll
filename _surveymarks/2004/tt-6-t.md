    I took some time on a beautiful Saturday morning to search for a few USGS
    marks along one of old railroad beds between Jessup and Throop. I had no
    luck with the first two, which were listed as chiseled squares on culverts,
    but I did find the third - a disk. Even though much has changed, the
    directions led me right to the spot, and the large rock was visible as soon
    as I stepped into the woods, as it was the only boulder in the area. The
    coordinates I pulled from the map were within 26 feet of the mark.  The
    boulder can be found by walking approximately 125 feet northeast along the
    old railroad bed from the corner of the fence shown in photograph #3 below,
    and then 100 feet southeast, straight into the woods.
