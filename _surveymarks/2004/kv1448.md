    After a morning of mountain biking at nearby Jacobsburg State Park, Rich and
    I rode to the Plainfield Township Rail-Trail for some more riding,
    geocaching and benchmark hunting. Unfortunately this mark, which we figured
    to be at the intersection of the rail-trail (the old DL&W right-of-way) and
    Engler Road, eluded us. We did find the remains of an old concrete culvert
    at the intersection but could find no evidence of the mark. It may have been
    on a section of the culvert that is lying on the ground, too heavy to lift,
    or it may be overgrown with weeds.

    **Mark not found.**


    This first order vertical control station appears to be situated at the intersection of the Plainfield Township Rails-Trail and Engler Road. The posted coordinates lead to this location. Some remains of a concrete culvert were found on the west side of the trail near the road crossing but the mark or any sign of it could be discovered in the portions of the rubble that are exposed.
