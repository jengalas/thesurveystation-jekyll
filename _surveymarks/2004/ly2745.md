    Rich and I discovered that the tower referred to in the description has been
    removed. The current replacement is a wooden observation platform in
    approximately the same location.

    **Station landmark no longer exists.**


    This third order horizontal control station was located and positively identified but the station landmark was destroyed. The steel fire tower was completely dismantled and removed, and a shorter wooden observation platform (which has no value as a geodetic control point) was constructed in its place. At the center of the new platform a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were identical (within 0.001 minute) to the adjusted coordinates listed on the NGS datasheet.

    _Note: Zhanna will take care of submitting an official “destroyed” recovery report to NGS along with photos of the available evidence._
