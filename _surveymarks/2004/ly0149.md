    After finding the nearby [A
    Bear in the Gunx](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY85_a-bear-in-the-gunx) geocache, Rich and I took a stroll across the highway
    from the Mohonk Preserve Visitors' Center to search for this mark. We found
    it well-preserved on a culvert that is, unfortunately, not so
    well-preserved. The area directly surrounding the mark seems solid, though
    the concrete on other areas of the headwall is crumbling. The mark was found
    as described using the historic description, except that we were unable to
    locate any definite indication of “highway survey station number 44+00”. The
    station designation has been painted in yellow on the highway shoulder just
    east of the guardrail, with an arrow indicating the direction to the mark.

    **Recovered in good condition.**


    This second order vertical control station is set in the top of the northwest headwall for a concrete box culvert under Rt. 44. The historical description was sufficiently helpful in finding the station but the “highway survey station number 44+00” was not seen. The station is almost directly across and a little south of the entrance to the Mohonk Preserve Visitors Center, and centered along a section of guardrail. At the station a Garmin GPSmap76 receiver with remote active antenna was used to record WAAS-corrected coordinates which were 109.8 feet from the scaled coordinates listed in the NGS datasheet. The mark is well exposed, in good condition, and the stamped designation is legible. The concrete setting, however, is showing signs of severe deterioration.
