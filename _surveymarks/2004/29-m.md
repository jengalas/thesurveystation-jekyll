    After finding [Tanners'
    Condos](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCKZHY_tanners-condos) and chiseled square [1102.46](/surveymarks/1102-46/) nearby,
    we left the gamelands at Tanners Falls and traveled north along Upper Woods
    Road to approach the coordinates I'd approximated from the map for this
    mark. We were pleased to find a convenient SGL parking area directly
    adjacent to the mark! Once we stepped into the woods the location of the
    mark was immediately apparent. The trees surrounding the boulder were blazed
    with pink paint and/or encircled with pink flagging tape. The disk required
    some cleaning, but was otherwise in fine condition. The stamping is light,
    but legible. All measurements match those in the description. We did not
    search for the reference mark at this time.
