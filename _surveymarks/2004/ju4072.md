    We work too hard for our money to gamble it away! So instead we spent our
    day in Atlantic City on the beach, and looking for benchmarks. This one was
    tempting not only because it's right on the boardwalk, but also because I
    liked the extra challenge of searching for a mark that a previous hunter
    couldn't locate. A short stroll up the boards from the convenient parking
    garage at Bally's brought us to Resorts Casino. It was immediately apparent
    that the two-story brick building (which once housed the James candy store,
    according to one web site), is now part of Resorts Casino and serves as a
    fancy side entrance to the casino. Aaron was the first to see the mark on
    the column. It is set as described, about 3.5” above the boardwalk and
    sidewalk, on the northeast face of the stone column facing Pennsylvania
    Avenue. (We could not find any reference to “Danny Thomas Avenue.” All signs
    and maps indicated that the street is named Pennsylvania Avenue.) The fire
    hydrant is located across the boardwalk in line with the lamps and benches
    overlooking the beach, and it is painted bright yellow. The mark's stamping
    is clearly legible.
