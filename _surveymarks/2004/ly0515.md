    I was in Warwick for a day of wine-tasting and touring the countryside with
    my parents. I happened to notice this mark while we were stopped on Main
    Street. My father was willing to pull over into the adjacent parking lot,
    and he even came along with me as I recorded the coordinates and took my
    photos. The disk is in good condition, especially for such an old mark. This
    building has made a neat transformation from an old church into commercial
    space; it now houses a video store and antique market, among other
    businesses.
