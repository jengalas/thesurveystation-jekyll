    On our way from Skyland to Big Meadows, Rich and I stopped at Crescent Rock
    Overlook to search for this mark, our third in the "MLS" series. [The others
    were 119 MLS ([AI5758](/surveymarks/ai5758/)) and [120 MLS](/surveymarks/120-mls/).] This
    was a relatively easy find. The details on the datasheet check out, and the
    disk is in good condition. I regret that I didn't use a tripod when taking
    my photos. This area is very dark under heavy tree cover in the Summer.
