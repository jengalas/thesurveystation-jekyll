    Rich and I found this mark as described, in the parking lot for the Stony
    Man trailhead. We were in this very same spot yesterday when we hiked the
    Stony Man Trail, but (believe it or not) I was feeling “benchmarked-out” and
    was more in the mood for dinner than for documenting yet another mark. So we
    headed to Skyland for a delicious, relaxing meal, and came back today to
    photograph this mark. We found the disk to be in good condition, and no
    changes to the datasheet description are necessary.
