    This benchmark eluded us today. Working from the NGS coordinates and description, we searched the area around the intersection of Main Street and Route 3 in Somesville, but were unable to identify the rock cut mentioned in the description. It almost sounded like we had to be significantly northwest of the junction of the highways, enough that it would put us up on top of the ledge over the intersection, although this would also seemingly take us too far from the road centerlines. Nevertheless, we searched up there too, and found nothing. What also makes this confusing is the fact that the north-south road is designated Routes 102 and 198 north of the intersection, and Route 102 south of the intersection, while Route 3 begins at the intersection and heads east, multiplexed (dually routed) with Route 198. Yikes! We'll have to try again in the future.
