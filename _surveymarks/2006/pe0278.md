    Soggy days such as this aren't my favorite for benchmark hunting, but four
    marks lined the route we were taking anyway, and I couldn't resist taking a
    peek for each one. The first mark was an easy find, and not just because
    Rich had already found it a few years before. It is set into a conspicuous
    rock outcrop down in a slight gully just north of Route 233. The mark itself
    was difficult to spot as it was covered with moss and debris, but we knew it
    was set somewhere in the ledge. It was just a matter of a minute or so
    before we uncovered it, and then another few minutes of slight inconvenience
    as I took my photos in the rain. The mark is in excellent condition.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along Route 233 from Bar Harbor and easily found the mark using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 386 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc was covered by a couple inches of dirt and dried pine litter, and is in very good condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
