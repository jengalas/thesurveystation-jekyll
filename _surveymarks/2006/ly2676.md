    Rich and I took a very quick look on a very cold day for this granite post. We were intrigued by the possibility of finding a potentially “ancient” mark, as marks go; the boundary was surveyed in the late 1700s, so we felt there was just the slightest chance the granite post might have dated from then. (The station disk, reference and azimuth marks were monumented in 1940, as described on the datasheet, but the granite post was already in place.) Unfortunately, though, we were unable to find any kind of a post in the area. It should have been easy to spot, especially if it still projects 15 inches. The coordinates are close to a road, however, and this very visibility may have led to the mark's disappearance, if it is in fact gone.
    
    
    Once the weather warms up, we will return and search for the reference marks and azimuth mark. It's not our style to give up so easily, but we're both Winter wimps who hate wind!
