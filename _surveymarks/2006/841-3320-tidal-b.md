    I only knew about this mark before our trip thanks to Papa-Bear-NYC on
    Geocaching.com. It's located between the famous cannons overlooking the
    harbor and is one of the neatest settings I've seen. With a monumentation
    date of 2005, it's brand new and the datasheet doesn't even appear on NOS's
    website yet. We found this mark on a drizzly-morning walk around town, after
    locating several other marks nearby ([AI8315](/surveymarks/ai8315/), [Tidal
    11](/surveymarks/841-3320-tidal-11/), [Tidal
    13](/surveymarks/841-3320-tidal-13/), and [Tidal
    14](/surveymarks/841-3320-tidal-14/)).
