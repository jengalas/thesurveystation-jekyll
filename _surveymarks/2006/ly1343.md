    This benchmark is the closest by far to my house (0.1 mi), and yet it's
    taken me two years to log it! (I even use it frequently to calibrate the
    altimeter in my GPSr.) Rich and I originally found this mark right around
    the time I moved to Jessup, but just never had the opportunity to log it
    properly. On this beautiful Spring evening I decided to try out his new
    camera, and I took a walk down to the bridge. The mark is in good condition
    and is set solidly in the bridge seat. There are some obvious mistakes in
    the description which I've clarified in my NGS report.
