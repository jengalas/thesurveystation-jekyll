    Though datasheets are not known for being laugh-inducers, the description
    for this mark had us in stitches all week—and not just after we'd been
    drinking 3 Blind Moose. (Check out the unfortunate misspelling of “Testa's
    Restaurant”.) I just knew we'd have to search for it before our vacation
    time ran out. The misty morning of Monday, June 26, our last full day in
    Maine, offered us just the perfect moment. After a lovely breakfast at
    Jeannie's (try the Eggs Benedict and crabmeat omelet!!!), we wandered around
    town in the drizzle and occasional sunshine. The bright red fire hydrant is
    like a beacon drawing one's attention to the mark. It cannot be overlooked!
