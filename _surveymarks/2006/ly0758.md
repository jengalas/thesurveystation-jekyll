    Rich and I were in the area and took a few moments to search for this mark
    today, without any success. Like Holograph, we noted the anomalous patch of
    gravel, but if the roads are in approximately the same location as when the
    mark was set, the gravel patch is too far from the roads' centerlines to
    have been the correct spot. Still, it is worthy of investigation. On a warm,
    sunny day we would have spent hours here if necessary, measuring from the
    roads and thoroughly checking all the visible outcrops, but today was far
    too frigid and windy. We hope to return!
