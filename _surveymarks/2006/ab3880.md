    After a day of (mis)adventures in the rain at Rockefeller State Park
    Preserve, Rich and I stopped at an overlook along Route 6 for a view over
    the river. There was a brief break in the rain and we hoped to catch a
    glimpse of Bear Mountain and perhaps some activity on the water. When we
    peered over the stone wall, however, another interesting sight confronted
    usâ€”a survey disk on the rock ledges below! We climbed down to it and
    discovered that it was PTOLEMY. Without a datasheet we weren't sure if there
    were auxiliary marks to be found; our brief search revealed nothing. We
    (correctly) guessed that since the date of monumentation was so recent, this
    may well be a GPS station without a need for reference marks. The disk is in
    good, but weathered condition and is set as described.
