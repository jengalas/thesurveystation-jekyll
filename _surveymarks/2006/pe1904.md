    This was to be the final survey mark find of our 2006 vacation in Acadia.
    After a lovely morning and afternoon spent wandering in downtown Bar Harbor,
    hiking around Jordan Pond, and visiting the azalea gardens, we decided one
    more tri-station was in order. Rich had already found this tri-station and
    both reference marks last year, so only one of us needed to find and
    photograph the marks this time (this was fortunate; the area was so buggy
    I'm glad we could wrap up the recovery quickly). Rich's assistance was very
    much appreciated. We found all marks to be in fine condition, and to match
    the datasheet's 1934 recovery note. This area is now wooded, very different
    from the pasture lands mentioned in 1870. The woods road (now called Stanley
    Mountain Road) is now paved.
