    This morning Rich and I revisited this mark, curious how it could've been damaged or removed as indicated in the previous log on Geocaching.com. We were pleased to find that **the mark is still intact** on the northwest wingwall of the north abutment of the bridge over Decker Creek. There may have been a mixup with the opposite corner of the bridge (the southeast wingwall of the south abutment), where the concrete wingwall was indeed damaged.
