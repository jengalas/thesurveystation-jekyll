    Rich and I spent a long time playing around at Millbrook Village today. It
    was my first time there and we had a lot of fun! Afterward, of course, we
    had to search for a few benchmarks. This one is located on an old bridge
    that has been demolished. The disk has some superficial damage to its
    surface but is still in good condition with legible stamping. We are not
    sending a report to NGS at this time because this mark was just officially
    recovered six months ago, and we have nothing else to add to that report.
