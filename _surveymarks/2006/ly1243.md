    After checking on a nearby mark that we'd heard might be missing (it
    wasn't), Rich and I enjoyed a peaceful drive along the Lackawaxen. The
    coordinates for this mark were stored in his GPSr, so we decided to take a
    look even though we didn't have the datasheet. The mark, set into the south
    end of the west abutment of a small bridge, was an easy find. It is in fair
    condition, one edge of the disk having been pried up. The disk is still
    solid in its setting.
