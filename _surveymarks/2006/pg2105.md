    On the final morning of our “Adirondack Mini-adventure,” Rich and I decided
    to do the tourist thing and drive to the top of Whiteface. Well, it wasn't a
    disappointment — and not only because there were two survey marks here to
    log! The drive itself was well worth the $14.00 toll, and our experience
    only improved as we neared the top. We decided to hike up the last several
    hundred feet from the castle to the summit, and when we were done, take the
    elevator back down the 27 stories to the tunnel, which emerges from the
    mountain just east of the castle. The elevator leaves from within the
    beautiful stone summit house which, along with the associated tunnel system,
    dates from 1937-1938. The light atop the summit house is the intersected
    point, as mentioned on the datasheet, and it appears to be in good
    condition.
