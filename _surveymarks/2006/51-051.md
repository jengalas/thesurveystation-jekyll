    This was another completely unexpected benchmark find. I honestly don't know
    how I missed this before, since it's directly in front of Rock & Snow, a
    well-known climbing and ski shop in New Paltz that I've visited quite a few
    times in recent months (once, three times in the same day!). After a
    gorgeous day of riding at nearby Minnewaska State Park Preserve, we stopped
    by at Rock & Snow to look for a particular pack that interested Rich. On our
    way out, I noticed the mark. It just appeared at my feet as so many have
    done before. “Well,” Rich said, “You know what you've gotta do!” I ran back
    to the car for my GPS and camera to document the mark. The designation is
    hard to read. The disk is also quite loose in its setting.
