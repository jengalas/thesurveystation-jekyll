    Y 144 was our fourth and final mark on this soggy Saturday. Rich stayed in
    the car for this one, since he had already found it and knew I would have no
    trouble. I scampered quickly up the bank on the south side of Route 198,
    found the ledge and the mark immediately. The mark may have been in recent
    use; I found a piece of pink flagging tape tied to a branch adjacent to the
    boulder.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along Route 233 from Bar Harbor and easily found the mark using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 66 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is quite visible and is in excellent condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
