    This disk was very easy to find, right on the corner of the boat ramp at the
    Municipal Pier. It was a drizzly day, but the sun came out while we were
    wandering around on the pier. It was a perfect day for watching the boats in
    the harbor. The disk is in good condition and undisturbed despite its
    exposed location.
