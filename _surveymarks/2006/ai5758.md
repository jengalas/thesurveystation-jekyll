    Rich and I first spotted this mark yesterday evening, when visiting Skyland
    for supper. At the time I was, however, sick of looking at benchmarks
    (believe it or not) and decided to save the recovery for our visit today. It
    is an easy find set on the steps leading down to the Skyland Gift Shop, as
    described. The disk appears to be in excellent condition.
