    After a meal of delicious pizza at Cara Mia in Dunmore, Aaron and I decided
    to park at his grandmother's house near Silver Lake and walk down to the
    tracks to investigate the old trestle over the DL&W tracks (now used for
    Steamtown excursion trains to Moscow). To my surprise, as we walked beneath
    the trestle, I happened to spot a benchmark disk set into the east abutment.
    I knew of its existence because Rich and I had planned to search for it on a
    ride at some point, but I hadn't realized it was on the trestle Aaron had
    told me about so many times. The disk is in good condition.
