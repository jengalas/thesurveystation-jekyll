    This was an unexpected find, and we still haven't found any further
    information about this mark. We were on our way back to Lake Placid after a
    disappointing trip to Whiteface (we'd hoped to watch the sunset from the
    summit, but the road had closed hours earlier). We were intrigued by the
    Wilmington Flume, and spent quite a long time poking around and taking
    photographs of the rushing water. A small overlook nearby seemed like it
    might offer better views of the rapids, so we split up and explored the
    area. I found nothing exciting, but Rich came across this chiseled square!
    It's just a few yards west of Route 86 near Whiteface. The stake and
    flagging tape look relatively new, but the mark could easily be older. The
    chiseled square is quite distinct, but we still might not have noticed it
    without the stake.
