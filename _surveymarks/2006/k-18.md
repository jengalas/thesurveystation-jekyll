    This USGS mark was an accidental find (sometimes they're the most
    enjoyable!). Somehow disoriented after hiking Norumbega Mountain, we took a
    wrong turn at a wooden bridge over a creek and ended up not on the trail
    back to the parking area, but directly on Route 198 a half-mile south of our
    goal. We decided to trudge back up the road rather than enter the woods
    again in search of the trail. And on our way, directly across the road from
    the outlet of Upper Hadlock Pond, I happened to look off to my left and
    spotted a witness post! The mark was well exposed and easy to see from a
    distance. This is one of several marks in the USGS “K” series level line
    that were not incorporated into the NGS database.
