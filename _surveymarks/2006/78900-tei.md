    While wandering around Big Meadows on the last day of our adventure in
    Shenandoah National Park, we stumbled upon a concrete post, leaning
    slightly, with a small survey mark disk set in its top! It appears to be a
    typical NPS boundary monument. Unfortunately, no further data is available.
    This is a wide-open, peaceful spot in the middle of the colorful meadow
    where we enjoyed both the hot sun and the gentle, cool breezes sweeping
    across the grassland. I'm glad we stayed for a while taking photographs and
    just wandering along the narrow paths that wind through the tall grasses and
    blueberry bushes.
