    The day was (and we were) really wet by the time we reached the junction of
    Routes 233 and 198. Fortunately, Rich had already found this mark several
    years ago, so we could simply park and run directly to it. He held back the
    branches of a nearby tree so I could get a decent view, and I took some
    quick photographs while trying to keep the camera dry. Like the others along
    this route, this disk is in good condition. We did not see the utility pole
    mentioned in the description.

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along Route 233 from Bar Harbor to the intersection of Route 198 and with some difficulty found the mark using the distances & bearings in the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 394 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc was buried under three inches of dirt and moss and not at all visible, but it is in very good condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
