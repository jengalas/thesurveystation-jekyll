    The station and all three reference marks were recovered in good condition on rock outcrops, as described. A drill hole was found in the outcrop near RM 3, but no attempt was made to match its location to the descriptions of drill holes provided in earlier recovery notes. After the recovery was made, rocks were again put in place over the station mark to return it to the same condition it was in when found. 


    The station is near the high point of Bald Hill in the Fishkill Ridge Conservation Area. It can be reached via the Fishkill Ridge Trail.

    This station has quite an interesting, and confusing, history.  The 1938
    recovery makes mention of setting an azimuth mark, which is not referred to
    anywhere else on the datasheet.  This same recovery also mentions an “old
    azimuth not visible due to heavy growth of brush and timber” and it's not
    clear what this referred to, either.
