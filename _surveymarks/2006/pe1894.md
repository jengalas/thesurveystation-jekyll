    This was a lovely late-Spring day that began chilly and foggy but turned
    sunny, dry and warm by noon. After our hike to ROBINSON MOUNTAIN (this
    feature is now known as Acadia Mountain) and an afternoon of lazing around
    in the sun at Ike's Point on Echo Lake, Rich and I passed by this church in
    Somesville and had to stop for some photographs. We wouldn't go out of our
    way for a station like this, but we couldn't pass it up while in the area.
    The church is pretty and seems well cared for. The spire was found as
    described.
