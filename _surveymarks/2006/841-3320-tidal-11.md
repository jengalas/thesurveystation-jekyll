    This tidal benchmark was not half as amusing as our previous find near the
    “Testes” Restaurant parking area, but it was still a neat find right on the
    corner of the pier, next to the NOS tide gauge station. It poured, drizzled,
    and the sun came out all in the three minutes it took us to find and
    document this mark.
