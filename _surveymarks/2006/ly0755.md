    Finally, some luck for our last mark of the day! After unsuccessful searches for three other marks in the “30″ series along the Flatbrookville-Stillwater Road ([LY0756](/surveymarks/ly0756/), [LY0757](/surveymarks/ly0757/), [LY0758](/surveymarks/ly0758/)) we were losing hope, but this mark was still in place and was easy to find. We pulled into the driveway of the old farm house (now the [Delaware View House](http://www.njskylands.com/pkdelvie.htm) General Store) and could see the mark’s concrete monument immediately, as it projects several inches. The disk is in excellent condition. Orange tape encircles the monument, so the mark may have been in use quite recently.
    
    
    If the day had been warmer and less windy, we would have stayed longer to explore the grounds and enjoy the beautiful view from the old farmhouse. As it was, we hurried back to the car after taking our photos and measurements. This would be a lovely picnic spot … in May!
