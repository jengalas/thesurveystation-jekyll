    With MARY as our main goal for the day, we began at the Buck Hollow Trail
    parking area and hiked WNW along the Meadow Spring Trail up to the A-T. To
    our dismay, when we arrived at the coordinates, we discovered that both MARY
    and R 17 are located atop a thin sliver of completely exposed rock.  We were
    able to climb high enough to see the station disk and R 17, but we just
    couldn't bring ourselves to climb all the way up with our equipment and
    stand in the ferocious wind.  A trio of hardy German hikers lunching atop
    the rock was all too eager to help us out, and they took a few very nice
    closeups of both marks for us.  R 17 has been scribbled on but otherwise
    looks to be in great condition, especially compared to its neighbor on
    Mary's Rock, MARY (HW3268).
