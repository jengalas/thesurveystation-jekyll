    On the final day of our “Adirondack Mini-Adventure,” Rich and I had set
    aside some time to look for survey marks. This one certainly didn't require
    much of a search, but it was still a neat find. The statue portrays the
    abolitionist John Brown and a young slave boy. It appears to be in excellent
    condition. We were slightly confused by the observed point mentioned on the
    datasheet—how could the center of the base have been visible from a
    distance? Perhaps we've misunderstood something.
