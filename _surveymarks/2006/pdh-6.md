    Rich and I came across this disk toward the end of a long day of [geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCZKJB_hmmmm)
    and [survey mark hunting](/surveymarks/ly2675/), just as it was
    growing darker and colder and windier. We took Vinegar Hill Road from the NY
    border toward Lanesboro, and while waiting to turn onto Main Street, Rich
    happened to glance at the old concrete bridge to his right. He saw something
    colorful, and I got out to check. I wasn't too surprised to see one of the
    typical aqua-colored, unstapdh6ed PDH disks that I've found on so many similar
    bridges. Though the cold was fierce, we managed to take a few photos and
    document the coordinates. This little discovery was a satisfying end to a
    very adventurous day!
