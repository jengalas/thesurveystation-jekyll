    This was a bittersweet find. I was so glad that we spotted not one but two
    unexpected disks while wandering Big Meadows, but sadly this was to be the
    last find of our lovely Shenandoah adventure. We found it very near the end
    of our stroll, at the western edge of the meadow above Tanners Ridge
    Overlook. The disk looks to be very old, but without a date stamped into it,
    we can't say for sure. Rich commented that this would be a perfect spot for
    a picnic, and I agree! We'd love to return, especially on another warm,
    sunny day such as this was.
