    Our second mark on this damp day, K 9 proved easy to find, but difficult to
    document. Our biggest problem was the swarms of mosquitoes fiercely guarding
    the mark! Old Route 233 is, as we expected, overgrown and mostly just a
    grassy clearing in the area of the benchmark. We found the large rock ledge
    and the mark easily, but trying to photograph it was murder amidst the
    swarming and biting bugs. We spotted a USGS witness sign about 22 feet to
    the west of the mark. It is not mentioned in the NGS description but is, in
    fact, part of the [1977
    revised USGS description](https://geodata.thesurveystation.net/USGS/ME/R_MountDesert_36.pdf#page=2).

    While vacationing on M.D.I. I decided to search for a few local benchmarks. I drove out along Route 233 from Bar Harbor and easily found the mark using the historical description. At the station my Garmin GPSmap76 receiver indicated approximately 83 feet from the posted coordinates. The disc is quite visible and is in excellent condition. ~Rich in NEPA~
