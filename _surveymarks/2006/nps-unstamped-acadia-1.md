    On a misty Friday morning, we set out to explore trails Rich had noticed on
    the map near Bar Harbor. We noticed that there was a small area of
    designated park land here by Dorr Point, but Rich had never walked the
    trails and in fact knew nothing about them. We overshot the parking area
    initially, and when turning around in the next street we encountered (Old
    Farm Road), I saw the bright orange witness post. I looked down quickly and
    spotted a small concrete monument and the unmistakable shape of a disk! We
    returned to the area to document our find after hiking around the point and
    exploring the ruins of George Dorr's estate (“Old Farm”). This NPS boundary
    disk appears to be in good condition, but has no stamped designation or
    date.
