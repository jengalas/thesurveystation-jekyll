    The station mark and reference marks 1 and 2 were recovered in good

    description remains accurate.

    On the final day of our “Adirondack Mini-adventure,” Rich and I decided to
    investigate Whiteface and see what all the fuss was about. I was intrigued
    by the mention of both a castle and a tunnel ... and the presence of a
    tri-station at the summit made the trip imperative. We had originally hoped
    to watch the sunset from Whiteface two days before, but discovered when we
    reached the toll gates that the road had closed early in the evening. It's
    just as well, because visiting the summit during this warm, dry, sunny
    mid-morning was a beautiful experience. We could see for many miles and were
    able to identify most of the high peaks and the nearby lakes. We were also,
    with minimal intrusion from the swarms of tourists at the summit, able to
    find and document the station mark and both reference marks. We found all
    three to be in good condition and as described by NGS in 1976. On our next
    trip, we'll attempt to locate the azimuth mark!
