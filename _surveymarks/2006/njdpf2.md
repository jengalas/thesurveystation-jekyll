    Just a few hundred feet along the Sterling Ridge trail from [NJDPF(1)](/surveymarks/njdpf1/), we spotted this disk. The two
    disks are identical, having no apparent designation or other identifying
    features. This 2-inch disk is set in a concrete monument projecting about 4
    inches above ground level.  This disk is just east of the northern wall (now
    in ruins) of the Old Long House.
