I received three documents from Harry Nelson of MaineDOT concerning magnetic stations. 

[Uses of Magnetic Stations](/assets/docs/publications/Special_Publication_No_213-magnetic-stations.pdf)

[Results of Magnetic Observations Made by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1914](/assets/docs/publications/SP-No-25-Results-Mag-Obsv-1914.pdf/)

One that might be possible for me to find is this one, in Hamburg, PA:

Hamburg, Berks County.-The station of 1910 was reoccupied. It is in the western one of two two circular plots 
near the center of the Union Cemetery, belonging to the Reformed Lutheran Church, about one-fourth mile from the 
center of town. The station is 6 feet west of the west edge of the driveway, 40.7 feet west of the southwest comer of 
the base of the tombstone of Stephen J. Smith, 49.6 feet south of the south face of the base of the tombstone of David 
Keller, and about 170 feet south of the gate of the cemetery. It is marked by a marble post 6 by 6 by 24 inches, lettered 
U.S. C. & G. S., set flush with the ground. The following true bearings were determined: 

South gable of stone farmhouse one-half mile away (mark) ................... 20° 37.6' west of north 
Cupola of barn 800 feet away................................................ 60° 48.8' east of north 

My best guess at the coordinates is: 40.557284, -75.976726.
