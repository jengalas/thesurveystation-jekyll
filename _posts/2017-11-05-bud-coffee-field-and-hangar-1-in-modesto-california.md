I'm so grateful to Gene Gomes for contributing the following diagrams of Bud Coffee Field and Hangar #1 in Modesto, California.

Gene explained:

> Bud Coffee Field was the original airfield of Modesto, CA prior to construction of the new airport location. Bud Coffee Field lives on now as the Modesto Muni Golf Course.
>
> Hangar #1 still exists at the (newer) Modesto Airport, and resides on the general aviation side of the airport, just off Runway 28L, on Tioga Drive. It is visible in aerial/satellite photos.

The images below link to the full-size PDFs. The Bud Coffee Field diagram contains three pages, so be sure to check them out!
