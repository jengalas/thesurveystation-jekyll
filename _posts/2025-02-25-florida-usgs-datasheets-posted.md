Recently I came across some USGS datasheets from Florida posted on [LABINS](https://www.labins.org/), Florida's Land Boundary Information System.

Unfortunately they were all scanned as individual pages in .tif format, so I downloaded all of the pages, converted them to PDFs, and georeferenced the quads.

Note that not all quads were available, and there are no datasheets for horizontal marks, only third-order leveling.
