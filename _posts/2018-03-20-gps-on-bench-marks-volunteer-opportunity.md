Fellow survey mark hunters, please consider helping NGS with this year's [GPS on Bench Marks](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GPSonBM/) initiative. Data submitted by August 31, 2018 will help in the development of the new geoid, GEOID18! 

All observations are welcome. If you don't have professional surveying equipment, no problem—please submit your observations, including field notes and photographs, to assist those who have pro equipment in finding the mark! 

And don't forget, even with consumer-grade GPS equipment such as a handheld unit or phone, you can always update the coordinates for marks with SCALED positions. 

To help focus efforts, NGS publishes a map of prioritized marks. These are selected marks that, if found and if observations are submitted, will help improve the new geoid. The list of prioritized marks is also available in Excel and other formats.
