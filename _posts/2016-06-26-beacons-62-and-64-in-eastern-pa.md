Bob Pastore submitted the following evidence of what remains of Beacon 62 in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania (approximate coordinates: N40.819438°, W75.874985°). He writes:

> 62 is just south of Summit Hill, PA—a little town that the star on the chart is just touching.  64 is on Blue Mountain on the Lehigh Water Gap near Palmerton, PA.  It appears as this is a CLE — NY or ORD — NY route.
>
> As a retired airline pilot I recall flying these routes using modern navigation aids and they went right over Summit Hill and Palmerton.
>
> If you look at the chart, note that there is an airway which comes out of Allentown VOR (the 291 degree radial noted on the chart), a modern day navigation aid put in place in the late 40s. They too are almost obsolete what with GPS.  The airway is from the Milford, PA area and note that it is just below the arrows of the beacon airway.  Not too far off as this was the principal route from CLE, DTW, ORD to NYC.
