Dave Izatt has submitted the following photos of [LP0496](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=LP0496) - SAN FRANCIS SALT LK AWY BN 57. The tower is gone, but the arrow is intact. Dave says that a 4-wheel drive vehicle with high clearance is required to drive directly to the arrow.


The beacon tower's description is difficult to find now, because it has been marked as Destroyed in the NGS database. Below is the original Coast & Geodetic Survey description written upon their observation of the site in 1940. Strangely, they claim "There is no concrete arrow to indicate the course." Is this a mistake in the description? I can't imagine the arrow having been added after 1940. Also of interest is that (according to Wikipedia) Low is a ghost town, abandoned in 1955 due to lack of local water.
