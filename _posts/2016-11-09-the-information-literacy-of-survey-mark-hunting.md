At long last, we've been published!

Over the past year, my colleague Donna Witek and I have been writing an article about the application of survey mark hunting as a recreational activity to the new Framework for Information Literacy.  In November the article was published in _In the Library With the Lead Pipe_, an open access, open peer reviewed journal. The writing and editing process (specifically the open peer review process) was a great experience for both of us. And the conversations we had with our two reviewers were invaluable in shaping the piece into what we think is fun and compelling readingâ€”rather on the light side for an academic work.
