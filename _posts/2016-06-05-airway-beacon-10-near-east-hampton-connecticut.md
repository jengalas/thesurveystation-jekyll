Michael LaRose has submitted the following photos from the former site of Beacon 10 on the New York—Boston airway (NGS PID [LX4898](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=lx4898)).

> [The site] lies next to a modern commercial communication tower right next to a condo complex.  I also found another USGS marker nearby which I presume was placed to replace the tower upon its demolition. The concrete pad is really the only evidence left and I walked right past it at first because it is quite overgrown.  There is a well right next to the pad but appears to predate the beacon based on its construction.

I think the well is the one referred to in the datasheet description for [BAKER](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=lx4924), the triangulation station at the site. (The marker he found is BAKER RM 2.)
