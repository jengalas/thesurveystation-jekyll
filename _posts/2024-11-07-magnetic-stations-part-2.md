Returning to [Results of Magnetic Observations Made by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1914](/assets/docs/publications/SP-No-25-Results-Mag-Obsv-1914.pdf/), I researched two other magnetic station locations that are close enough to me that I might be able to search for them, although they are both long shots.

The first is:

> Easton, Northampton County.-The station of 1910 was reoccupied. It is in the northwest part of the March
athletic field of Lafayette College, 38 feet southeast of the concrete wall surrounding the field, 12 feet northwest of the
outer edge of the running track, and 1 foot southwest of the continuation of one of the sides of the baseball diamond.
The station is marked by a marble post 6 by 6 by 15 inches, lettered U. S. C. & G. S., and buried with its face
flush with the ground. The following true bearings were determined in 1914: 
>
> Tower of courthouse ......................................................... 23 30.0 west of south
>
> South College ............................................................... 36 44.8 east of south
>
> Northwest gable of fraternity house ......................................... 65 25.5 east of north

Given all the changes that tend to accumulate on college campuses over the years, it's unlikely this station still exists (or is findable). But it's worth a look, particularly if I'm in the area. 

March Field still exists, although Google Maps doesn't label it as such (Waze does - and a monument to "March Field" is visible on Google Street View). PennPilot imagery from 1938 indicates that is has changed size a shape a bit over the years, and new buildings now surround it. But the old imagery depicts the baseball diamond, which may help in determining the site of the station. 

Using the bearings provided, and assuming the surveyors used the obvious high points on the Northampton County Courthouse and South Hall, an estimate of the station coordinates is **40.698472, -75.21125**. This is on the site of the former Olin Hall, built in 1956-7 (now refurbished and incorporated into the Hugel Science Center, circa 2001). So assuming these bearings are correct, it looks like the station is probably gone, or at least covered by buildings that were erected long after this document was published. But there is always a chance, and I would love to check it out!
