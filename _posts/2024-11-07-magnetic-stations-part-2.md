Returning to [Results of Magnetic Observations Made by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1914](/assets/docs/publications/SP-No-25-Results-Mag-Obsv-1914.pdf/), I researched two other magnetic station locations that are close enough to me that I might be able to search for them, although they are both long shots.

The first is:

> Easton, Northampton County.-The station of 1910 was reoccupied. It is in the northwest part of the March
athletic field of Lafayette College, 38 feet southeast of the concrete wall surrounding the field, 12 feet northwest of the
outer edge of the running track, and 1 foot southwest of the continuation of one of the sides of the baseball diamond.
The station is marked by a marble post 6 by 6 by 15 inches, lettered U. S. C. & G. S., and buried with its face
flush with the ground. The following true bearings were determined in 1914: 
>
> Tower of courthouse ......................................................... 23 30.0 west of south
>
> South College ............................................................... 36 44.8 east of south
>
> Northwest gable of fraternity house ......................................... 65 25.5 east of north

Given all the changes that tend to accumulate on college campuses over the years, it's unlikely this station still exists (or is findable). But it's worth a look, particularly if I'm in the area. 

March Field still exists, although Google Maps doesn't label it as such (Waze does - and a monument to "March Field" is visible on Google Street View). PennPilot imagery from 1938 indicates that is has changed size a shape a bit over the years, and new buildings now surround it. But the old imagery depicts the baseball diamond, which may help in determining the site of the station. 

Using the bearings provided, and assuming the surveyors used the obvious high points on the Northampton County Courthouse and South Hall, an estimate of the station coordinates is **40.698472, -75.21125**. This is on the site of the former Olin Hall, built in 1956-7 (now refurbished and incorporated into the Hugel Science Center, circa 2001). So assuming these bearings are correct, it looks like the station is probably gone, or at least covered by buildings that were erected long after this document was published. But there is always a chance, and I would love to check it out!

This one also intrigues me:

> Laporte, Sullivan County.-Observations were made at a point about one-fourth mile north of the center of town
in a pasture lot belonging to Mr. McFarlane, lying on the west side of the highway to the railroad station, and just
north of a lot containing the ruins of a schoolhouse burned down about 1906. The point is 230 feet west-northwest
of the gate to the pasture, 110 feet east of the edge of woods along a creek, and 190 feet south of a maple tree 18 inches
in diameter which stands at the corner of the fence to the school lot. The point is marked by a natural outcrop of
rock about 3 feet by 3 feet in area, and having a magnetic station disk cemented on to this rock. The following true
bearings were determined: 
>
> Steeple of Episcopal Church (mark)........................................ 5 58.1 west of south
>
> South gable of red frame house, one-fourth mile away ....................... 61 57.6 east of north
> 
> East gable of barn on hillside about 1,500 feet away ........................... 49 32.0 east of north


This one is very difficult to determine! Right now my best guess, based on nothing but going back and forth between the description, PennPilot imagery, and modern maps, is somewhere around **41.4310285, -76.490615**. I will have to check it against the bearings but a preliminary look doesn't seem to work out.
