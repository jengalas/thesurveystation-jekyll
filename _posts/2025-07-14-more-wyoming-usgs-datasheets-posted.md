Thanks to website contributor Julian Sanchez, and the fine folks at USGS who made and provided the copies to Julian, we have five new quads for Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park!

New quads are:
- #317 - Grand Teton No. 4
- #318 - Grand Teton No. 3
- #346 - Grand Teton No. 1
- #404 - West Thumb
- #432 - Canyon Village
