Jeff Jalbrzikowski of NGS was kind enough to send me the full run of scanned USGS datasheets (15' topo quads) for Kentucky, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. It was such a treat! 

I have a few of the states nearly ready to go, and Maryland is complete.

Thank you so much, Jeff, for reaching out and providing me with this fascinating historical data!
