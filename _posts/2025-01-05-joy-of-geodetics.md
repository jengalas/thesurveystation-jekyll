Recently while updating this website, I came across a resource that will be useful to other recreational survey mark hunters:

**Joy of Geodetics: An 8-Part Geodetic Survey Markers Educational Series,** by Greg Shay of the United States Power Squadrons

While I have to admit that some of the official recoveries by the Power Squadron that I've come across are of ... shall I say  _highly variable quality_ (to the point that it has become a bit of an inside joke), Mr. Shay has done a great job here of describing the different types of survey markers and how they are used, how to search for them, and how to submit observations and photographs to the NGS database. 

The titles of each document explain the contents pretty well, but Mr. Shay also provided an [outline](https://www.usps.org/images/Exec/CoopCh/PDFs/2020_JOG_Series_Outline.pdf) for even greater detail.
