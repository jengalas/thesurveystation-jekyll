Jack Fawcett visited this tower near Polkinghorne Spring, Nevada on June 2, 2016. The tower was nearly intact, except for the glass lens (pieces of which he found at the site) and the carbide tanks. There is 4WD vehicle access to within one mile of the tower; from there, a hike up the hill is required. A [geocache](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC34VKD_who-turned-out-the-lights-12-polkinghorne-beacon) is hidden at the site as well.

According to website contributor Harvey Hartman, this tower is of the style produced by IDECO (the International Derrick & Equipment Company), as shown in the 1928 brochure [IDECO Airway and Airport Beacon Towers](/assets/docs/publications/1928-Ideco-Airway-and-Airport-Beacon-Towers-Brochure.pdf).
