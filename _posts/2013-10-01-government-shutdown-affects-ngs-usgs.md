Due to the government shutdown, the NGS and USGS websites are currently unavailable.  

Archived NGS datasheets (from 2000-2001) are available at Geocaching.com: [http://www.geocaching.com/mark/](http://www.geocaching.com/mark/)

These are useful only for benchmark hunters and are not to be considered reliable survey data.

Some USGS datasheets are available here: [https://thesurveystation.com/usgs-datasheets/](/usgs-datasheets/)

NOAA's [Tides and Currents](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) website is still active.  Tidal bench mark datasheets are available here: [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Bench+Mark+Data+Sheets](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Bench+Mark+Data+Sheets)
