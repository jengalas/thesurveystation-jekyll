The photographs of this beacon site were contributed by Dean Draper.  The site is located in Millard County, Utah, about 20 miles southwest of Delta. Also in the same location is the NGS triangulation station [BEAK](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=ko0428) (KO0428). 

Please leave a comment if you have more information about this beacon, perhaps its number or any details of its history.

A USGS topo map of the area shows the triangulation station, but no beacon.  Could the designation BEAK derive from the word "beacon"?
