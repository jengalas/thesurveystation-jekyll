      alt: BCN 27 Looking NW. Desert Wind Rd. on the left.

      alt: Sandy on BCN 27
    - filename: MAP-135_BCN-27-6cm
      alt: What appears to be the location of an old monument that was set in the concrete pad on the tail of the arrow. Oddly enough, there is no NGS datasheet associated with this marker.

      alt: Looking SE from BCN 27. The road in the background is to a gravel pit on Regina Rd.

      alt: Arrow is a shelter for critters. And what's left of the tower.
    - filename: MAP-135_BCN-27-8cm
      alt: Tail of BCN 27. The location of the suspected monument is near the center of the pad, however most locations of these monuments according to the NGS datasheets are the center of the tower.

      alt: Looking South to the intersection of Desert Wind Rd and Regina Rd. The name of the road is different from the name of the old town(?) shown on the topographic maps of the area, which call it out as Regena. Airway Map 135 also describes this as “Regena”.
    - filename: 100_7563cm
      alt: Parking SE of BCN 27 at the base of the hill. The marker is on private ground, but is not signed.

These photos were submitted by Glen Smallwood in March 2015. They show the current status of Salt Lake City to Boise Beacon 27.

This beacon does not have an NGS PID. [Airway Map No. 135](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701pm.gct00064/?sp=167) (Salt Lake City Utah to Boise Idaho, 1936) was used to identify it.
