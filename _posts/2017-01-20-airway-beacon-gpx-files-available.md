At the suggestion of website contributor RiverPilot, I've created .gpx files of the airway beacon data. Each waypoint contains the beacon name, NGS PID where applicable, and location (latitude/longitude). The files are available on the beacon pages as well as for direct download here:

[Airway Beacons—Eastern U.S.](/assets/data/airway-beacons-eastern-us.gpx)

[Airway Beacons—Eastern U.S.](/assets/data/airway-beacons-western-us.gpx)

Next up, .kml files!
