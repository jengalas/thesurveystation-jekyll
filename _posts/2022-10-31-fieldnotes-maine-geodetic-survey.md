Thanks to Harry Nelson, Senior Geodesist and CORS Project Manager at the MaineDOT Property Office, today we have an article about marks placed by the Maine Geodetic Survey, a Civil Works Administration program. 

As Harry notes, I have Maine Geodetic Survey Station data and diagrams available [here](/assets/docs/publications/Maine-Geodetic-Survey-Stations-1933-1935.pdf).

The article below is excerpted from <em>FieldNotes ... The Monthly Newsletter of the Maine Society of Land Surveyors</em>, September 2022. The full issue is linked below, as is another recent issue. All items are posted with permission.
