David Izatt has submitted the following photos of an arrow at the site of [SAN FRANCISCO—SALT LAKE AIRWAY BEACON 59](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=LP0482) (the beacon is now destroyed).


Dave writes: "This arrow has also been recently painted with orange paint. I do not know the story behind this. The arrow is on the south side of the Great Salt Lake. It can be accessed from the dugway exit on Interstate 80. The road is gravel and dirt. Most vehicles should have no problem. Coordinates are: 40.7500160°,-112.6482090°."

As always, thanks for your contribution!
