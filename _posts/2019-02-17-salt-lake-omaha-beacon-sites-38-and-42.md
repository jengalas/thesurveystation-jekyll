## Beacon SL-O #38

Jack writes: "Just a few dozen miles to the west of SLO42 and the very first beacon arrow I ever saw in person.  This picture and my visit were made in 2015.  As you can see, it looks like someone 'salted' the ground around the arrowhead - nothing grows there.  Made me wonder if some Beacon-keeper had trouble with weeds overgrowing the marker and decided to do something about it!  This one is easily visible on Google Earth."

## Beacon SL-O #42


Jack has also submitted some photos of the site of beacon #42 from different vantage points.  He writes: "The arrow points east (towards Omaha, of course). Easily seen once you walk a dozen yards off the road. Tail, square tower pad and arrow head are all present and complete."
