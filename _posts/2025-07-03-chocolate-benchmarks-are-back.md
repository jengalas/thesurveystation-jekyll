Nearly 20 years after I first wrote the [blog post about making your own chocolate benchmarks](/2006/01/10/chocolate-benchmarks/), Bruce Bourgoine, Executive Director of the Maine Society of Land Surveyors, contacted me to ask if he could publish it in an upcoming issue of  _FieldNotesâ€¦ The Monthly Newsletter of the Maine Society of Land Surveyors._ Well, this big day is finally here! A reprint of the blog post is available in the June 2025 edition.
