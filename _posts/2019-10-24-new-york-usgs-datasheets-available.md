Today we have the scanned USGS datasheets (15â€² topo quads) for New York! Big thanks to Jeff Jalbrzikowski of NGS, who sent me the files.

Coverage of the state is nearly complete; Neversink is the only quad that wasn't available.

There are some very interesting datasheets in this collection. For example, check out the marks on the Statue of Liberty's pedestal ([New Brunswick quad, page 11](https://geodata-ngs-usgs.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/USGS/NY/6-New-Brunswick/Horizontal.pdf#page=11)). And [West Point](https://geodata-ngs-usgs.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/USGS/NY/27-West-Point/USMA.pdf) contains some really interesting history and diagrams from the U.S. Military Academy.
