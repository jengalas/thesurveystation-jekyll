Today Rich and I came across this awesome video featuring Dave Doyle, former chief geodetic surveyor of the National Geodetic Survey, giving a tour of historic survey monuments in Washington, DC. We learned so much from his presentation, and we even bought the book (_The Jefferson Stone_, by Silvio Bedini) that he recommends in the video.

Follow along by checking out the NGS datasheets linked from the map below. You can also [download a .gpx file](/assets/data/posts/geodata/washington-bms.gpx) of the markers shown in the video.
