      alt: BCN 25 at the entrance to the Mountain Home Municipal Airport. The tower appears to match the tower remnants and BCN 26 & BCN 27, however it appears that the majority of the arrow was removed when the entrance was constructed. The original pad appears to be buried under several inches of landscape rock.
