To add new marks, move the all-points.md file out of _hidden and into _pages, so it will render.

Go to the rendered page on the website at /all-points/

Highlight and copy the new marks, then paste into a csv file.

Open the .csv file in Excel; may need to do some manipulation to prevent Excel from converting the time/date field. 

Add the header row: designation,status,condition,time,permalink,lon,lat,image and save the file.

Then go to geojson.io and click Open. Open the .csv file and let it create the geojson file.

Select and copy the new marks from the generated file, and then paste them at the top of /assets/data/all-points.geojson. Then check the map of recoveries to make sure the new marks were added and look correct.

Move the all-points.md file back into _hidden.

Make sure to update data/locations if new states, counties, or quads were added.
