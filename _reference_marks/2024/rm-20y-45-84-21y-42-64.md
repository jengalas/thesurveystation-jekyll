  I'm not sure exactly what the story is with this marker - it appears to be a reference mark for two different disks, 20Y and 21Y. I think I found 21Y RESET, but for some reason didn't notice 20Y. This disk is set in the curb of the sidewalk on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard, near the volcano display at the Mirage Casino.
