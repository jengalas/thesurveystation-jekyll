  Dad and I were bummed that we didn't have the proper attire, tools, or amount of time to search properly for MAPLE. But at least the reference marks were easy finds.  MAPLE RM 1 is just across Maple Street from the station coordinates, set in the sidewalk in front of #228 Maple Street. The disk is in very good condition, with just some slight scratching on the surface that has not jeopardized its legibility. As I photographed the reference mark, a man came to the door and opened his screen door, I guess to check out what I was doing. I started to tell him how lucky he was to have a survey disk set in his sidewalk. He just stared at me with blank eyes, and very slowly closed the door. I guess he wasn't interested. Oh well.
