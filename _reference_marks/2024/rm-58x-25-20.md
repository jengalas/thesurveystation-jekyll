    This appears to be a reference marker for nearby right of way disk 058X, which I found two days ago. There is some debris (a small stone?) on the disk that I was unable to remove because it was on the far side of the barrier between the sidewalk and Las Vegas Boulevard. I don't think the stone is obscuring any stamping, but it's possible that it might be. The disk appears to be in good condition. It is located about 8 meters north along the curb from 058X.
