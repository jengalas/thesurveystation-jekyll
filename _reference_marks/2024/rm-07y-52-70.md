    This appears to be a reference marker for 007Y, which I did not locate. There is a listing on waymarking.com for 007Y (see [Las Vegas Strip Right of Way Benchmark #007 Y](https://waymarking.com/waymarks/wm7EBQ_Las_Vegas_Strip_Right_of_Way_Benchmark_007_Y)), and although many of the Las Vegas Strip benchmarks listed there have since been destroyed due to construction, I don't think that would be the case for this one. However, I simply didn't spot it for some reason. The reference mark is still in good condition with legible stamping.
