  Dad and I were bummed that we didnâ€™t have the proper attire, tools, or amount of time to search properly for MAPLE. But at least the reference marks were easy finds. MAPLE RM 2 is set just west of RM 1 and the station, in the driveway of #230 Maple Street. A car was parked next to the driveway and the mark was a little too close to the house for my comfort, so I just took a few very quick photos. The disk is in good condition, with some scratching and a gouge on the surface, but no damage that would compromise the mark's integrity or legibility.
