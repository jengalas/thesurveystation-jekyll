    This was the second benchmark hunt (and the first totally successful one) of
    our first day in Shenandoah National Park. Rich and I entered the park in
    Front Royal, at the northern terminus of Skyline Drive, and spent the rest
    of the afternoon enjoying a leisurely drive through the northern section of
    the park, stopping here and there at various overlooks and attractions. The
    interchange with Route 211 was our stopping point for today, and how
    appropriate! — an azimuth mark was located somewhere in the grassy area
    encircled by the exit ramp. A short walk through the scratchy brush brought
    us directly to a large boulder and the mark set on top. It's in good
    condition, and no additions or corrections to the datasheet description are
    necessary.
