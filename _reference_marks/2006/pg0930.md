    Recovered in good condition. The disk is an azimuth mark disk, not a
    reference mark disk. Power pole number 25-182 was not found in the vicinity.
    The witness post still exists. Autonomous (non-corrected) handheld GPS
    coordinates for the azimuth mark are 44 15 23.5(N) 073 58 25.6(W).

    Rich and I recovered this azimuth mark as part of our recovery of [PG0932](/surveymarks/pg0932/), the JOHN BROWNS GRAVE tri-station.
    The azimuth mark is in good condition. We had some trouble finding it, as
    there is no longer a power pole 14 feet from the mark, and the scaled
    coordinates took us to a point just a bit too far south along John Brown
    Road. Once we walked just a few more yards north, however, we spotted the
    witness post and then the mark.
