    Rich and I walked to this mark from HW3272, as it's less than a tenth of a
    mile southwest along Skyline Drive. It's located on a huge rock ledge just a
    few feet east of the road, making for an easy find. The mark appears to be
    in good condition and the datasheet description is accurate.
