    We took the following measurements, which will be included in the NGS report
    (to be submitted after we search for the station and reference marks). The
    azimuth mark is approximately 16 feet at 204 degrees magnetic from the
    centerline of the road. It is approximately 6 feet at 24 degrees magnetic
    from a post and wire fenceline. The monument has been disturbed, but the
    concrete is still solidly embedded in the ground, and the disk itself is in
    good condition.
