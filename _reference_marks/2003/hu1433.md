    This reference mark disk was found in good condition as described, atop the
    Transpeninsular Line monument stone just south of the Fenwick Island
    Lighthouse. The 252 year old monument is part of a line that was surveyed to
    settle a boundary dispute between the Penns and the Calverts, and which
    established the middle point of the peninsula. The historic description was
    adequate to locate the mark, but the following changes should be noted:
    State Road 14 is now State Highway 1, and the sand road is now paved and is
    labeled 146th Street.
