    Reference mark 2 was recovered in good condition.  It is now flush with the
    ground.  The blazed trees were not found. A new route is required because
    the roads described are no longer  passable by vehicle.  The station may be
    reached on foot from the lower day-use area of Nescopeck State Park, but a
    stream crossing is necessary.  If permission can be obtained, the best
    approach may be to park along the shoulder of Interstate 80 westbound and
    hike approximately 350 feet directly north to the mark.

    Reference mark OLEY No. 2 is set in the top of a square concrete monument located approximately 78 feet south-southwest of the station. It is now well exposed, in very good condition, and the stamped designation is clearly legible.  ~Rich in NEPA~
