  Our first mark of the day is a mere 13 meters from a USGS mark we found back in 2007. This one, a MaineDOR survey control disk, was set in 2011, so it wasn't even here the last time we visited this ledge. I just love this area. Although it is literally a few feet away from the highway, something about it feels so peaceful and serene. I would love to sit here and read, or have a snack in the sunshine. Anyway, we found the mark easily, and then confirmed that K 10 (the USGS mark) is still in place (it is).
