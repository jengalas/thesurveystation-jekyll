Now that you've done some research and gathered your equipment, you're ready to set off on an adventure!  Your adventure will be your own, so there isn't much I can tell you here other than to follow your datasheet and your instincts, and prepare for the unexpected. 

Going back to my example, let's say I walk down the street toward the bridge mentioned in the description. (Please note for posterity the nice blue sky, which is quite rare for Northeast PA.) 

 

LY1343 bridge

 

I'm supposed to be looking for the mark on the north end of the east bridge seat.  My compass tells me which one this is (you could figure this out from the map, too) and I climb up there.  Uhhh, I don't see anything ... and the mark can't be hiding beneath any dirt or weeds, because the top of this particular bridge seat is clear.  There's no mark here, and no hole or anything else to indicate a mark ever was set here. 

So let's look around a little.  Surveyors may be professionals, but sometimes they make mistakes too!

I climb up on the opposite corner—the south end of the west bridge seat.

 



 

Well, this looks promising.  But we have to read the disk and make sure the designation is correct!  Otherwise we won't know if we have found the right survey mark.  (Especially in cases like this where the description seems wrong, you want to be absolutely sure you're looking at the right mark.)

A closeup view gives us our answer:

 



 

It's E 56!  I take some time to record a good coordinate reading from my GPS receiver, and I take the photos you've just looked at.  I also make a few notes on the datasheet, particularly about the mistake in the original description, so I can report them later.  And that's about it!  One successful survey mark recovery.

This is the simplest example just to get you interested and to illustrate the process, but there are many other twists and turns these adventures can take.  A hobby of survey mark hunting can take you to extremely beautiful and interesting places that you never would have known about otherwise.

And now the disclaimer: hunting survey marks can also put you in contact with surly property owners, vicious dogs or wildlife, and unforgiving terrain.  I've been cut, bruised, yelled at, and called a terrorist, though so far no one has called the police on me (to my knowledge anyway).  I always respect private property but that doesn't matter to some people—they may try to claim that public property or highway right-of-way is theirs.  If you trespass, knowingly or unknowingly, then you'll put yourself at an even greater risk, and only you can decide if it's worth it.  Don't say I didn't warn you!
