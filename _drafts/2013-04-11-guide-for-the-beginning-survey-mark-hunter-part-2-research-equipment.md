So you want to try to find a survey mark. How to start? Well, you need a target mark. You'll generally want to find out everything you can about your "target" before you head out into the field to find it for real.

There are many ways to go about researching survey marks. For now, I'll focus on what I consider the easiest way to get started.

<h3>An example</h3>

Begin at the Geocaching.com Benchmark Hunting page. For my example, I'll use a zip code near me. I'll type 18434 into the "By Postal Code" search box in the upper right, and check out the results. The first one that comes up is "LY1343 - E 56." Click it, and you'll see Geocaching.com's page for this survey mark.

There's a lot of information here that the beginner doesn't need yet, but take a look at the map in the right-hand column. Oh—I recognize those streets. Let's look a little closer and see if we can find out more about the mark.

Click the link (the text is small!) near the top of the page that says "view original datasheet." And now ...

<h3>How to read a datasheet</h3>

Whether you're following my example or choosing a mark near you, take a close look at the datasheet.  At the top you'll see the <strong>Designation</strong>.  This is just the "name" of the mark.  It's what is usually stamped into the disk, and this is what you need to see in order to confirm that you've found the right mark.  In my example, E 56 is the Designation.

After that you'll see the <strong>PID</strong>; in my case, it's LY1343.  The PID is a randomly assigned number.  It means nothing and you will not see this number on the survey mark itself, but you'll need to know it in order to report your find to the National Geodetic Survey if you decide to do that. 

Next, you'll see the <strong>state and county</strong> where the mark is located, as well as where its location can be seen on a map, if you're so inclined.  After that, you'll see <strong>a whole bunch of confusing numbers and notations</strong>.  The only thing you want to check is the field labeled <strong>Marker</strong>; make sure it says "bench mark disk," "triangulation station" or something similar (there are other kinds of marks, but we'll stick with the metal disks for now.) 

If you have a GPS receiver and want to use geographic coordinates to find your mark, then you can use the very first line of numbers beneath the phrase "Current Survey Control."  Otherwise, just ignore this entire section.  You're not a surveyor; you don't need it.

The most important information for the beginning survey mark hunter is the <strong>description</strong>.  Scan down the datasheet to the part labeled Station Description.  Here you can read about the history of the mark, in chronological order, from the time it was set to the most recent report.  There will be technical terms that you can again ignore.  You're just looking for things like "set vertically in the south wall of the Mayberry Post Office" or something like that.  You want a place that's easy for you to identify.  
 

<code>STATION DESCRIPTION</code>

<code>DESCRIBED BY NATIONAL GEODETIC SURVEY 1942</code>

<code>AT JESSUP-PECKVILLE.</code>

<code>AT JESSUP-PECKVILLE, LACKAWANNA COUNTY, 500 FEET SOUTH OF THE DELAWARE AND HUDSON RAILROAD STATION, AT THE CORNER OF MOOSIC AND DELAWARE STREETS, AT BRIDGE 67/23 OVER MOOSIC STREET, AND IN THE NORTH END OF THE EAST BRIDGE SEAT.  A STANDARD DISK, STAMPED E 56 1934.</code>

 
From the datasheet I'm using for my example, I see that my target mark is (or was, in 1942) on a bridge in my town that I think I know.  So now I've just got to check it out!

As you read through the descriptions of survey marks near you, you will probably see several whose locations you can pinpoint just using the descriptions and your familiarity with your town.  There may be one on your school, the post office, or along the path where you walk your dog.  Maybe you've seen one already, even if you didn't know what it was!

In this situation, all you really need to bring is:
<ul>
    <li>a smartphone with a downloaded copy of the datasheet <b>and/or</b>:</li>
    <li>the printed datasheet (if applicable) and a pen (so you can make notes)</li>
    <li>a camera of some kind to document your find.</li>
</ul>

Once you've got a few finds under your belt, you'll want to try for the harder marks.  In my adventures over the years, I have used all of the following:

<ul>
   <li>GPS receivers of various types</li>
   <li>Smartphone</li>
   <li>Topographic maps</li>
   <li>Compasses (map, sighting, optical)</li>
   <li>Long fiberglass measuring tape, short steel tape </li>
   <li>Trowel, shovel, clippers, machete, hatchet, folding saw</li>
   <li>Metal detector and soil probes</li>
   <li>Flagging tape, spray paint</li>
</ul>

etc.  You get the idea—this can become pretty intense!  But for most marks all you'll really want is a camera and datasheet, some common sense and good judgment, and a compass and GPS receiver.  This will help you get close to survey marks in more remote locations. 

Note: I prefer a dedicated handheld GPS unit to a smartphone's integrated GPS for several reasons. A hiking GPS is typically rugged and waterproof, has easily swappable batteries for longer hikes, and is easier to read in bright outdoor conditions. But when necessary I've used my phone successfully too, so it may work for you.

By now I'm sure you're ready for the adventure!
