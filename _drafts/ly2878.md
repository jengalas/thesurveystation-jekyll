  I was in the area this morning to accompany my father to a medical appointment, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to document this mark (which Rich and I are sure we've seen before when we visited this "bridge to nowhere", but for some reason we didn't recover the mark at that time). It felt a bit strange to use such an occasion for a benchmark hunt, but I'd recently heard that this bridge is to be demolished soon, so I wanted to have a record of the mark before the demolition occurs. 
  
  
  Based on the mark's location on the parapet wall at the very end of the bridge, it is possible that it may remain in place even after the demolition, but I didn't want to take any chances. Once the bridge is gone, we can return to this spot and submit a recovery of the mark's fate, whatever it is. For now, the disk and its setting are in good condition.
