This magnetic station has sent us down several historical rabbit holes, and we haven't even searched for it in person yet. Most of the magnetic stations listed in these old documents seem very unlikely for us to find (they're either in locations we never visit, were searched for and not recovered 100 years ago, or were at or below ground level as of their last recovery). 

But this one in Ellsworth gives me a bit of hope. We can visit the location easily, next year when we're in Maine, and the mark is set on a relatively large monument. 

> Ellsworth, Hancock County.-The station is one-half mile east of the center of town in the old fair grounds, about 
180 feet south of the entrance gate. It is outside of the race track, and about 8 feet west of the foot of the embankment 
at the west end of the course. The station is marked by a bronze disk set in the top of a concrete block 6 by 6 inches 
on top and projecting 16 inches above ground. The following true bearings were determined: 
>
> Cross on Catholic Church (mark) .......................................... 80 20.3 west of south 
>
> Southeast corner of brown house .......................................... 42 02.8 west of south
> 
> East point on roof of house of ex-Senator Eugene Hale ...................... 25 35.4 west of north 
>
> Vane on steeple of Congregational Church ................................. 86 31.6 west of south 

So far we've determined that:

1. It's likely that the old fair grounds were at the site of the current-day Fairground Road.
2. The former house of Senator Eugene Hale was somewhere on the high spot north-northwest of the fair grounds. We suspect somewhere on Maddocks Avenue, although the nearby, suspiciously-named Hale Place is another slight possibility (I say slight because assuming we have the correct location of the entrance road to the fair grounds, the bearing doesn't line up).
3. The two churches referred to in the description are still in place, and bearings taken from the points cross near the fairgrounds road.
4. We have no idea what the "brown house" might have been and if it's still standing.

In trying to find the location of Eugene Hale's home, we came across the following article from _The New York Times_, July 14, 1883:


We also found a few postcards showing the senator's home, Google Street View didn't hel
