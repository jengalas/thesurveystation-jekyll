<strong>Adjusted</strong>: a notation on an NGS datasheet indicating that the geographic coordinates for that mark have been surveyed to high precision.  You can expect your GPS receiver to take you directly to the mark.

<strong>Bench mark/benchmark</strong>: technically, a type of vertical control — a survey mark set to establish a precise elevation.  Commonly, this is used among hobbyists to refer to many types of survey marks.

<strong>Geodetic surveying</strong>: branch of surveying that uses extremely precise methods to determine the geographic positions of points and the form and dimensions of the Earth.  

<strong>Horizontal control</strong>: marks set to establish a precise horizontal (i.e., latitude/longitude) position.  Types of horizontal control may include triangulation stations, traverse stations, drill holes, landmark/intersection stations, and GPS stations.

<strong>Landmark/intersection station</strong>: a structure that can be viewed from a distance and serves as a type of horizontal control (historically; these are rarely used now).  May be a church steeple, smokestack, or fire tower. There is no disk — the structure itself is the mark.  To recover these, you must prove that the structure is the exact one described on the datasheet and has not been moved or altered.

<strong>Monument</strong>: While marks are set into massive structures (e.g. bridges) or outcropping bedrock when possible, in some locations a special concrete monument must be poured and the mark set into it instead.  The shape and size of the monument are designed so that it will be solid and stable in the ground and will extend past the freeze line. 

<strong>NGS</strong>: National Geodetic Survey, an agency of the U. S. Department of Commerce, that manages a national network of survey marks and related data. 

<strong>Recovery</strong>: term that describes the activity of locating and documenting a survey mark.

<strong>Reference mark</strong>: a mark typically set within several meters of a triangulation station in order to aid in the recovery of the main station.  The datasheet states the distance and compass direction from the triangulation station to the reference mark. 

<strong>Scaled</strong>: a notation on an NGS datasheet indicating that the geographic coordinates for that mark have not been surveyed to high precision but have instead been estimated from a map.  You cannot expect your GPS receiver to take you directly to the mark; you will probably have to use the description.

<strong>Triangulation station</strong>: a specific type of horizontal control whose exact position has been determined by the mathematical process of triangulation.

<strong>USGS</strong>: U. S. Geological Survey, an agency whose mission is to study and provide information on the Earth's resources, including landforms, water, energy, and biological and mineral resources. 

<strong>Vertical control</strong>: marks set to establish a precise vertical position (i.e., elevation) relative to a datum (usually mean sea level).  Types of vertical control may include bench mark disks, squares or crosses chiseled in rock or concrete, nails or pipes set into monuments.
