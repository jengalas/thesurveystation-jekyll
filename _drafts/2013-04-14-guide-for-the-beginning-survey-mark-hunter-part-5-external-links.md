Finding Your Way With Map and Compass: https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2001/0035/ USGS provides a brief explanation of topographic maps and how to use them with a compass.
NGS Datasheet Search: https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datasheets/  More advanced survey mark hunters will want to go directly to the NGS database to research survey marks.
NGS Survey Mark Recovery and DSWorld: https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/surveys/mark-recovery/index.shtml and https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/PARTNERS/  Once you have a lot of experience, you may also want to submit an official recovery.
USGS Datasheets (Sample): https://thesurveystation.com/USGS/PA/166-Scranton/Vertical.pdf  Sample scanned USGS datasheet (Scranton, PA, 3rd order leveling). Unlike NGS, USGS does not have their data digitized so very little is currently available on the web. If you find a mark that's not listed in the NGS database, it may be listed here.
Sources of Local Control Data: https://thesurveystation.com/local-control-monument-databases/  A list of local/regional agencies that set their own survey marks. If you've found a mark that's not NGS or USGS, it may be here!
Standard marks of the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey https://thesurveystation.com/manual-of-geodetic-triangulation-excerpts/standard-marks/  Scanned from the NGS publication "Manual of Geodetic Triangulation," this image shows some common types of survey marks.
Marking the Surveysâ€”NOAA's Commemorative Marks: https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/survey_marks/  This site highlights special survey marks set to commemorate important events (Lewis and Clark, 2002 Winter Olympics, and 2000 Center of U. S. Population among others). The site also provides solid background information about the National Geodetic Survey and the history of survey marks.
The Historic Coast and Geodetic Survey Photo Collection: Geodesy https://www.photolib.noaa.gov/cgs/geodesy.html  Through photographs, this beautiful site honors the triumphs and difficulties of our nation's first surveyors.
