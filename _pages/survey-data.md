## Sources of survey data

This list contains both professional data and information for recreational hunters, so please note the source of each and evaluate accordingly. Also note that some sources, USGS datasheets in particular, contain many superseded marks that are no longer reliable for survey purposes but are very useful for recreational survey mark hunting.

## Selected historical data

These sources represent the types of historical documents I often consult when searching for marks, and are specific to the areas I search. You will likely find similar resources for other areas by searching [Google Books](https://books.google.com), the [NOAA Library](https://library.noaa.gov/coast-geodetic-survey), the [NGS Publications Library](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/library/), and the [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/).
