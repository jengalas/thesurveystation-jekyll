# USGS Datasheets

These are links to USGS datasheets I have collected and scanned over the years. They are by no means complete and the marks described are in many cases considered obsolete for purposes of survey control. However, they are great resources for survey mark hunters!

If you have more USGS datasheets that you would like to share, please post a comment.
